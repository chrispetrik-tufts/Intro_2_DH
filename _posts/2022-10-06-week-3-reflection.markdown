What are the digital humanities?
	I think that one of the issues that I have with this question is limiting the digital humanities to a tool with humanities itself. When I think about the majority of scholarship in my humanities subjects (Greek, Latin, and philosophy), I do not really think of the digital aspect because of how new and emerging this type of scholarship is. For example, when I read an essay, the author usually goes out and reads the essays of hundreds of other people in their library, but does not usually use any type of digital tools or algorithms to help them support their case. Instead, the person relies on the opinions of other people to support their own opinion. Sadly, people tend to fail to find more unique and important evidence when creating an essay. In turn, the people are saying the same conclusions from the same evidence. However, since the skills and tools within the discipline of digital humanities are so new, the new scholarship is able to find countless new ways of finding and presenting new evidence. In turn, digital humanities because the differing required skill set establishes itself as its own proper discipline, instead of a tool or subdivision of humanities.

What are some questions this article produces?
	My first question about digital humanities is, “when will people start to have the general acceptance that digital humanities is its own discipline, instead of a subdivision of computer science and humanities?” I think that this question is very important for the field, mostly because it is able to better solidify digital humanities within an academic institution. Sadly, funding has a lot to do with what type of research gets to be done. The faster that digital humanities gets recognized, the faster that it can receive more funding, and the faster it can grow as a discipline.
	My second question is , “are there any figures fighting for digital humanities in the academic sphere?” I know that professor Crane is a leading figure in this field of research, but I do not know much more about the other figures in the discipline.
