I think that there are a few interesting points about the reception of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, especially in regards to Gibbon’s treatment of certain religious,  racial, and ethnic groups. I think that putting the blame on specific religious groups, namely Christians, is a very strange argument to make. One thing that is very interesting to me is that the change in moral values really changed the sociopolitical structure so dramatically that the empire was doomed to fall. In the early Roman Empire, my interpretation is that the relaxed laws concerning other religions and ethic groups allowed many other societies to have slightly good relationships under the empire. When I say this, I mean that the subjugated societies had the best possible relationship with the empire, not that it would be the best result for the subjugated society. Although I definitely have much less experience studying the christians in the Roman Empire than Gibbon, I do not know how much more oppressive the christians could have been than the original rulers. 
Moreover, I think that the comments about the Jewish community is entirely unacceptable. He says that they are “a race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but also of humankind.” I am guessing that what he is talking about in this excerpt is that the Jewish people did not want to make sacrifices to the roman gods because they did not believe in these gods, nor did they believe that their god was interchangeable with the roman gods. I understand that the lack of subservience to the empire could pose political threats to the empire, but I think that making the statement that the Jewish religion is incompatible with the rest of the world is entirely rooted in antisemitism. 


Questions:

How can Gibbon claim that he is not a biased author with these statements about certain ethnic groups?
Should I be more open to dismissing the biases because they were a product of his time? No
