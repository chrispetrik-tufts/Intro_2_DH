Why do I read?
I read because I love the act of reading. My main consumption of literature is in the audiobook format. Although some people would argue that audiobooks do not count as reading despite covering the text with my eyes in the same way I would without the audio, I think that audiobooks count as reading. When I open up a new book, I very much enjoy the smell, especially when the book is old. I also like when the audiobook reader has a very strong or smooth voice. Most people would say that they enjoy learning from books, but I do not really feel like I am necessarily reading for learning or culturalizing myself. I am not trying to say that I do not learn or come into contact with new material, but I think that the reflective aspect of reading comes secondary to me. 

Kirsch
I do not know if I can really get on board with very much of what Kirsch argues. I feel like digital humanities are just such a young discipline that it is hard to argue for the lack of value in their work. I feel like Kirsch is just scared because his discipline is going to intrinsically lose sway as digital humanities gain power. I am not arguing that digital humanities would totally abolish the previous framework for research, but it will definitely take away some of the power from it to make room for itself.

Wellman
I do like thinking about reading from a religious standpoint, but I also recognize that anything that I say about reading to someone who denies the existence of a god or gods will probably not be swayed by my argument. I do think that reading has a very self-reflective nature. In the humanities, I need to figure out how a certain text applies to myself. However, this interpretation usually comes after I am finished reading. I don't think that distance reading will necessarily replace reading, but I think that they both have their benefits. I could distance read all of Marcel Proust's work and get a decent understanding of it. However, I do not think that I would be able to bond with Marcel (the character) in a meaningful way from distance reading. That being said, I do not know whether I will ever have time to read all of In Search of Lost Time with the effort it deserves.
