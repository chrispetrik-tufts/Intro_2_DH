I found one of the sentences from the article by professor Crane very interesting. Professor Crane wrote, “While we can certainly build smart texts, such technology is only a means to a larger goal: to foster the development of smarter readers.” In this section, professor Crane is talking about intertextual analysis in secondary readings. With the new tools in digital humanities, the person reading the text can easily see the citation and the article that the person is citing. In turn, they can determine whether the citation actually supports the argument that the person is making. In this way, the scholarship can come to a much higher level much faster. In turn, the scholar making these distinction within the text can make their own work better much faster, better showing their scholastic ability. 
Professor Crane later writes, “One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage.” Although I agree with the second part of this statement, I think that it would be interesting to dive into the first part a bit more. It should be relatively obvious why machines may have a better opportunity to make their thoughts more permanent. I think that with special types of AI, we are seeing that the machines are able to make associative trails very well. I do not think that they are as good as humans yet, but I think that they have undergone tons of progress since this article was released in 2019. For example, GPT-3 was released and can think extremely well. Despite all of this, computer scientists are having a difficult time understanding how these machines are learning, and I would really like to see this become studied more in the future. 

Questions:
Can we quantify how the smarter texts make smarter readers?
When will machines be able to make human associative trails as well as humans?
