What are the humanities?
	I think that the first thing that I would like to do is analyze the author’s definition of humanities. They say, “The humanities include a plurality of scholarly disciplines such as the study of history, languages, religions, and art from various times and places, and, often comparatively, linguistics, literary studies, cultural studies, philosophy, religious studies, and area studies.” First, I do not think that Socrates would be very happy with this answer. I think that Socrates would say something along the lines of, “I asked you what is virtue and you gave a variety. If I asked you what a swarm is, you wouldn’t go and list all of the bees.” Or something along those lines in the Meno. That being said, I think that there is a much more important thing to take away from this definition and close to an answer as to why we do not have a great working definition for ‘humanities.’ Namely, the question of what constitutes and does not constitute studies in the humanities is very difficult. For example, the author lists linguistics under the study of humanities, but the contemporary linguists would not consider themselves to be studying humanities. They would argue that linguistics is the science of language. That being said, contemporary linguists tend to ignore much of historical linguistics in favor of evidence which is much harder to define and organize, such as spoken language, leading them to fail to distinguish between what constitutes good and bad evidence. Anyways, they would not consider themselves to be part of the study of humanities. 
	Another point that I find to be very interesting is that the author highlights that the humanities develop a sense of empathy within the person studying humanities. They claim that it helps people to take on other people’s perspectives and partake in civil discourse. Although I would like to agree with this statement, I feel like humanities also trains people to be the least civil in discourse. For example, the people trained in rhetoric are going to be able to come up with much better insults than someone untrained. We can see this in ancient oratory.

Questions
	Will we ever have a set definition for humanities?
	Do the humanities foster empathy?
