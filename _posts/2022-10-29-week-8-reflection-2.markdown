The most exciting part of the reading from “The Measured Words: How Computers Analyze Text C” was probably the inclusion of the Chinese room analogy from Searle. I have always thought about this story and found it very odd. I do have an issue with the Chinese room, however. I do not believe we should have a huge problem if I change the reading of symbols to speaking sounds. Whenever the man is given a sound, he provides the proper sound in response. Instead of continuously reading from the book, let’s say that the man becomes extremely proficient at memorizing the Chinese sayings and answers. He is so gifted that he remembers every sound and has the appropriate response in his head. We then take him out of the Chinese room and put him in China. The people come up to him and start speaking Chinese to him. He gives back the proper response and even goes into deep conversations with the people. How are the Chinese people ever supposed to know that the man is not speaking Chinese when he gives all of the proper responses? He gives no hint that he is just giving back the memorized sound. 

In this way, how are humans supposed to understand that the computer does not understand language? The computer has greater access to language than us, and it gives the perfect response back every time. From a practical standpoint, the computer is speaking English or whatever natural language we choose. Saying that the computer is not speaking a natural language or the man in china is not speaking Chinese because he is not conscious of it is counterintuitive. I think that the reason why it stands out to me so much is that it questions my understanding of what it means ‘to know’ something. Does an entity necessarily need consciousness and self-awareness to know something? I don’t know the answer to this question.

This is a bit of an aside, and I do not want to make it seem like I am trying to fearmonger, saying that there are machines making plenty of responses to us without us ever knowing, but I do not know how we would ever tell.
