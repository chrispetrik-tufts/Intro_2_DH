Snowball Effect:
	I am very interested in the snowball effect of digital humanities, making internet repositories and social media forums to gain support. The more people learn about these projects, the more people will join. I am unsure how these projects share their process with others, and I am disappointed that this article did not go too in-depth with them. 

Citations:
	That open-source code and the ability to cite note by note fascinate me. I would like to know more about this type of citation. From an outside perspective, seeing someone cite note by note would be very difficult. It would be similar to citing everything, word by word. I am curious how they would determine what is worthy of a citation and what is not. The citations of certain phrases are much better at the moment, but I could be persuaded if someone explained them to me better.
	Although citing particular songs is extremely important, the music industry could use this technology to take money from small creators. If someone has a program that can take all the patterns from each song, it would be effortless for a music company to accuse all the small creators of copyright infringement based on the code. Moreover, the code would strongly prove that the person is using the same music. I am not saying that it is okay to steal music. There is so much overlap in songwriting that it is difficult to escape accidentally breaking copyright. Large-scale music publishers have a stranglehold on the current domain of music and rampantly accuse people of copyright infringement. Since they prey on smaller artists, the artists do not have the monetary support to counter the claims and their legal cases. Therefore, large corporations have a lot of power against them. Will this code help the corporations put down the smaller artists?
