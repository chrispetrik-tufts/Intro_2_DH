## Evaluation

Enslaved.org is a digital repository that archives the history of the transatlantic slave trade. This website can also be classified as a discovery hub for people interested in the history of the slave trade or people interested in creating datasets and digital projects. From this website, someone can find specific data and apply it to different visualizers to help show people's more significant relations and movements. This project aims to archive the stories and lives of enslaved people with an easy-to-use interface and help researchers (among others) find excellent resources. 

The most impressive technology in this website is the advanced and thorough tagging system that the website has implemented. Although I cannot see the source code for the material, the people are likely using an XML or CSV file with extremely efficient tagging. The most prominent example for me is tagging people by their origin. Users can sort through data by gender, age category, ethno-descriptor, role types, and occupation. All the different functions and tags have merit, but the ethno-descriptor is the most exciting tag for me. I can see where any documented enslaved people came from using this tag. Not to mention, the list in this set is more extensive than any of the other categories. They have over 400 different labels for the ethno-descriptor. Although this does not account for every group or nation that people were imported from, the vast tagging is impressive. I cannot imagine how much time it must have taken to input these different values. 

The greatest strength of this project is its breadth and searching ability. There are so many different sources on this website, and the website is easy to navigate and search. Anybody semi-competent with a computer could easily find information on this website, even my grandparents. However, the amount of information may also be a drawback. Although the website provides many sources, it may be hard to understand which ones are essential and which are less important. The website has a featured people section to combat this issue, but this section would be much more helpful for someone just browsing as opposed to someone with directed research. The only way that I could change this website is to give the ability to get recommended searches as well as recommended people.

This website has many contributors, including the Mellon Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, Michigan State University, the University of Maryland, and UC Riverside.
