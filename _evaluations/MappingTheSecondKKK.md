## Evaluation

Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940 is a digital repository making an interactive map of the United States representing each local affiliation of the Ku Klux Klan with a red dot. This project is hosted at Virginia Commonwealth and developed by the university faculty and students. Although the first and third appearances of the Ku Klux Klan remained mostly in the American South, the second appearance was much more geographically widespread. This spread may have been linked to the second Klan’s appeal to racism, anti-Semitism, and anti-Catholicism. Not only does this map show the location of the Klan within a local area, but it also gives information on the specific “Klavern” (a local Ku Klux Klan group) and the people fighting to oppose the Klan. The website uses technology such as website integration. This project uses google maps to map the Ku Klux Klan through their website. 

The goal of this project is to make a highly accessible map of the second wave of the Ku Klux Klan, provide historical sources to people doing research, and teach general awareness of the Ku Klux Klan within someone’s local region. This project is very useful for anyone trying to either date Ku Klux Klan hideouts or learn about the Ku Klux Klan from historical sources. This website is extremely effective in achieving this goal. The interface is smooth and easy to use. I do not think that anyone would have difficulty navigating this website. Naturally, I wanted to see if there were any Klaverns in the Boston area, where I was born and raised, and I was able to find multiple Klaverns easily. The website then gave me sources describing the Klaverns. This news that the Ku Klux Klan was so prevalent in my home city bothers me, but I am glad that I am now more educated on the matter.

The strengths of this project are the easy to use interface and the citation of sources. I think that the interface is accessible to anyone regardless of their expertise on a computer. In other words, I think that my grandparents would have no issue using this website, which is probably the best compliment I can give a website in terms of usability. One way that I would like to see the project improved is by making the sources accessible by links immediately upon clicking on the location. I realize this feat may be difficult given that many of the sources come from news reports which are not yet in the public domain, but I think that it would make the website exponentially better.
