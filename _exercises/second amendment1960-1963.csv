RLA Promises
Wharf Space
For Merchants
Progress Report
Is Effort to Satisfy
Relocation Pleas
By ALFRED ALIBRANDO
Star Staff Writer
The District Redevelopment
Land Agency today said its
plans for reconstruction of the
Maine avenue waterfront now
Include a place for the small
restaurants and seafood stores
which have complained so bit
terly about being forced to move
from the Municipal Fish Mar
ket.
In a progress report on the
waterfront plan he is develop
ing for the RLA, Stanley M.
Sherman said there also will
be provisions to relocate the
marine supply shops and stores
that now occupy the waterfront.
Presentation of the plan at
the RLA’s regular board meet
ing today obviously was an
answer to proposals from Capi
tol Hill for rehousing the em
battled restaurants and seafood
merchants who have refused to
move from the Southwest fish
market.
Chairman McMillan of the
House District Committee has
proposed a National Fisheries
Center to replace the old fish
market. And Senator Beall. Re
publican of Maryland, a mem
ber of the Senate District Com
mittee, introduced legislation
authorizing construction of a
new fish market ‘'on or near
the waterfront"" to rehouse any '
displaced businesses from that
area.
Effort Plan
Since both these proposals
would upset the RLA’s water
front plans, which have been
under development for nearly a
year, today's report apparently
was an effort to save the plan
and satisfy any merchants who
wish to be relocated on the
waterfront.
In outlining his plan Mr. |
Sherman said piers at the site
of the present fish market, at
the foot of Eleventh street,
would be retained for the han
dling of boats bringing in sea
food from the Chesapeake Bay
and lower Potomac River areas.
Hogate's Restaurant would be
moved from its present Maine
avenue location to a pier site
just south of Yacht Basin No 2
and the Flagship Restaurant
would move to a pier at the
foot of M street.
Space for Others
Between these two large res
tauranta, sajd Mr. Sherman,
would be space for many
smaller restaurants and retail
and wholesale seafood stores.
One problem for the small
restaurant operators and sea
food merchants now on the
waterfront is that they would
have to move to temporary lo
cations between the time the
old fish market is demolished
and new quarters are com
pleted. They contend that re
development plans should have

North Sea Storm
Sinks Dutch Ship
LONDON, Jan. 20 (AP).—A
Dutch coastal vessel capsized
and a German freighter was
missing today in blizzard and
hurricane force winds whipping
the North Sea and the north
ern half of the British Isles.
The 195-ton Dutch coaster
Bermuda sank near the Hook
of Holland, the Norwegian radio
at Stavanger reported. The
number aboard was not learned.
Five ships of three nations
searched the raging North Sea
for the 871-ton German
freighter Luhesand with 12
men. The Luhesand radioed a
call for help last midnight and
had not been heard from since.
Her last report said her hatches
were broken and water was
pouring into the hold.
The blizzard buried Northern
England and Scotland under
ice and snow, marooning scores
of villages and freezing at least
one person to death. Thirty-five
passengers were stranded over
night aboard a passenger train
1 mile from Aberdeen.

Almond Backers Offer
Broad 3% Sales Tax
Plan Covers Food, Autos, Drugs,
Clothing, Items Costing 11 Cents
By ALEX R. PRESTON
•tar Staff Writer
RICHMOND, Jan. 20.—Gov. Almond'a tax program which
would impose a 3 per cent levy on virtually all retail xales
above 10 cents was placed before the General Assembly today.
The tax legislation Introduced in the House lists few ex
ceptions and embraces almost every facet of daily living,
including food, cars, drugs and clothing.
Among the few exemptions are gas, electricity and water.
Also on the exemption list is 1
gasoline, which already is sub
ject to a 6 cents per gallon
tax.
Delegate Charles K. Hutch
ens of Newport News, chairman
of the House Finance Commit
tee, introduced the measure
Gov. Almond outlined his tax:
program in general terms earli
er to an Assembly already di
vided over the merits of adding
Virginia to the list of sales tax
States.
The Governor’s bill carried
with it this indorsement by
Tax Commissioner C. H. Mor
rissett, who has helped knock
down retail sales tax bills in
past years:
""If the recommended appro
priations are to be made, this
is the best way to meet them.”
$142 Million Gain
The Governor’s tax program
would produce $216.8 million
lin new revenue in the next
biennium. Offsetting this would
be relief to income tax payers,
corporations and Businessmen,
which reduce the net gain to
the State to $142 million—a
sum Gov. Almond figures he
: needs to finance a $1.3 billion
| budget for the next two years.
The sales tax would apply
to groceries and meals in res
taurants, and to drugs.
Purchases of automobiles—
old and new—would fall within
' 1 its scope.
It would apply to materials
used in the building of new
’ homes. Also, to hotel and
rooming house bills.
( It would be added to the cost
1 of cigarettes and liquor.
Gov. Almond had warned the
1 Legislature that ""exemptions
ought to be held to a reason
• able minimum.""
i
Things Exempted
In addition to gas, electricity,
' water and gasoline, such things
> as machinery and tools used in
manufacturing processes, fer-
■ tilizer, farm equipment and
livestock would be exempted.
i Every jurisdiction surround
ing Virginia—Maryland, West
j Virginia, Tennessee, North
■ Carolina and the District of
Columbia—except Kentucky—
has a sales tax.
If a family from tax-free
Kentucky moved into Virginia,
it would be liable for Virginia's
3 per cent sales tax on the au
tomobile, refrigerator, stove
and all other personal property
according to a briefing given
reporters by State Tax Com
missioner C. H. Morrissett.
If a family moved from the
District of Columbia, which
(has a 2 per cent tax. into sub-
I urban Virginia with its pro
posed 3 per cent levy, it would
be assessed for the 1 per cent
difference, the tax commis
sioner said
During the recent Christmas
shopping season, thousands of
automobiles bearing Maryland
and District of Columbia tags
1 were observed crossing the Po
tomac River bridges into Vir
ginia.

V J V WITH SUNDAY MORNING EDITION
l~ ~.
Mann has said that such large
department store branches in
Virginia as Woodward & Loth
rop. the Hecht Co.. Lansburgh’s
and smaller firms, estimate
that 25 per cent of their busi
ness comes from out of State.
The tax commissioner was
asked about the effect of Vir
ginia's proposed sales tax on
this business now transacted
in this State.
""Logically.” he replied, ""you
would expect some loss, but we
have no way of estimating
that.”
Coupled with the sales tax,
he explained, was a proposed
""use tax."" This means, in ef
fect, that a Virginia resident,
subject to a 3 per cent tax,
could buy a car in the District
| of Columbia under a 2 per cent
rate, but still be assessed in
this State for the 1 per cent
difference when he registered
his car here.
Newsstands Included
The tax would apply to cor
ner newsstands, but not to in
dividual vendors of newspa
pers.
Gov. Almond said there ap
pears to be no practical wav
of meeting the State's fiscal
needs except by enactment of
a retail sales tax. His entire
budget is predicated upon its
enactment at the rate of 3
per cent.
The proposal is the most ex
plosive issue facing the 1960
General Assembly.

tax bill included Delegates

U. S. Concedes
Lead in Space
Prestige Cost High,
Merchant Testifies
By WILLIAM HINES
■tar Science Writer
The United States ""clearly
concedes” Soviet superiority in
outer space, and this Russian
advantage is costing America
dearly in terms of world-wide
prestige, a top State Depart
ment official admitted today.
Furthermore. Undersecretary
of State Livingston T. Mer
chant said, the Russian lead
“will take time to overcome.""
This unqualified administra
tion admission of the Nation’s
No. 2 position in outer space
came at the opening of a
lengthy series of hearings by
the House Committee on Sci
ence and Astronautics.
Mr. Merchant told the space
committee that Soviet propa
ganda. relying on the spectac
ular aspects of rocketry, has
given the world an exaggerated
picture of Russian achieve
ments. However, he said.
""Soviet propaganda has with
some success capitalized on the
technological achievements of
the Soviet Union.” He added:
“It would be wrong and dan
gerous to discount either the
achievement or the impact of
that achievement on the minds
of peoples all over the world.""
Administration Hit
Space Committee Chairman
Brooks, in an opening state
ment. lashed the administra
tion because ""the United States
space effort has reached nei
ther the pace nor the propor
tions” Congress had hoped for
in passing the Space Act 18

can space program.”

Hoffa Trial Set
Next Month on
Fund Charges
Action Brought
By Monitors Could
Unseat Union Head
By the Associated Press
United States District Court
Judge F. Dickinson Letts today
set for February 23 the trial;
of James R. Hoffa on charges
aimed at Mr. Hoffa’s removal )
as president of the Teamsters
Union.
The trial was set on charges
by the court-appointed board
of monitors that Mr. Hoffa
mishandled over $600,000 in
funds belonging to Mr. Hoffa's
home Local 299 in Detroit—
partly to help finance a Florida
real estate development.
Mr. Hoffa has denied that in
handling the funds he broke
the terms of a consent order
that allowed him to take over
the Teamsters’ presidency in
early 1958 under watch by the
monitors. The order established
strict standards for union of
ficers safeguarding union
money.
Advance Testimony Sought
The monitors, headed by
'Chairman Martin F. O’Don-'
I oghue, filed notice they plan
Ito go to Detroit next week to
get advance testimony, byway
of deposition, from Owen
(Bertt Brennan, a Teamsters
national vice president and
Detroit Teamsters official.
The monitors also served
notice they will demand from
Mr. Brennan, under prior court
authority, certain union rec
ords dealing with advances
from the Detroit local to Mr.
Hoffa.
The monitors have com- i
plained that Mr. Hoffa ob
tained about $600,000 of Local
299 funds and deposited the
■ money without interest in'
'banks in Orlando, Fla.. Cin-I
cinnati, Ohio, and New York, i
A deposit of $400,000 in the
Florida National Bank of Or
lando is the main basis for the |
trial. The monitors maintain'
the money drew no interest be
cause it was in reality collateral
for a loan to the Sun Valley
Development Corp., a real es
tate project.
Had Option to Buy In
Mr. Hoffa had an option to
buy an interest in the project.
There was testimony before the
Senate Rackets Committee
that, for a time. Teamsters
members in the Midwest area
were encouraged to buy retire
ment sites at the Sun Valley
project.
Mr. Hoffa sold his option in
November. 1958, but this was
some eight months after issu
ance of the consent order al
lowing Mr. Hoffa to become the
union’s provisional president
under the strict requirements
for fund handling.
A State court recently dis
missed a suit by Mr. Hoffa to
require the Florida National
Bank to let Mr. Hoffa with
draw the $400,000 deposit and
return it to the Detroit local.
The consent order under
which Mr. Hoffa is serving as
Teamsters president resulted
from a compromise of a law
suit in which a group of
Teamsters members from the
New York City area sought to
prevent him from taking of
fice. The dissidents contended
he rigged the 1957 Teamsters
convention at which he was
elected.

U. S. Wasted Millions
In Bolivia, Senators Say
McClellan Unit Blames Loss Since '53
On Laxity by Officials of Both Nations
Millions of dollars have been wasted on the United
States aid program in Bolivia since 1953, a Senate committee
'charged today.
In a report to Congress based on unpublicized closed
hearings of the Senate Investigations Subcommittee last
summer, Chairman McClellan, Democrat of Arkansas, blamed
the ""heavy losses"" on laxness
by American and Bolivian
officials.
The United States has spent
$l3l million on Bolivian aid
(since 1953. the report said.
' The subcommittee's findings
are expected to provide ammu
nition for those in Congress
demanding cuts in President
Eisenhower’s foreign aid re
quests.
Senator McClellan reported
that the United States failed
to collect counterpart funds
from the Bolivian government
from 1954 to 1957 and said
$2 million is still owed.
“Enrichment” Charged
""Some 18 distributors have
become enriched while projects
which needed this financing
were impaired,” the Senator
said.
Counterpart funds are those
paid by a country for aid re
ceived and are used largely for
improvements within the coun
try.
The investigating subcommit
tee was unable to come up
with a total figure on losses be
cause of incomplete records.
Losses Listed
But it listed losses of more
than $7 million on a number
of projects. These included:

Kennedy to Put Name
In Wisconsin Primary
By CECIL HOLLAND
Btar Staff Writer
Senator Kennedy has decided
to enter Wisconsin’s Democratic
presidential primary for a head
on test of strength with Sen
ator Humphrey of Minnesota.
The Massachusetts front-run
ning candidate for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination
will fly to Wisconsin tonight
for an expected formal an
nouncement at a news confer
ence in Milwaukee tomorrow
morning.
Kennedy aides had a ""no
comment"" on whether he would
announce his entry into the
primary at that time. But it
was recalled that Senator Ken
nedy has said he would make
the announcement in Wiscon
sin if he decided to enter.
The Senator’s obvious de
cision ended speculation over
what he would do about Wis
consin.
Called Unfair Test
Only last week, the Senator’s
brother Robert, one of his
campaign advisers, said he
thought a test in Wisconsin
would be unfair because it ad

his brother not to enter the

New Algerian Crisis

PARIS, Jan. 20.—The color
ful, tough-talking French para
troop general, Jacques Massu,
may not be exactly in the same

has officially denied having

""Many claims for such losses

Senator McClellan said, ""are

The report cited evidence

Apparently this left Senator
Kennedy with little choice but
to enter the Wisconsin primary.

Senator Kennedy leading in
the State, it is a Humphrey

Indicates He
Is Aiming to
Lessen Load
By LEE M. COHN
Star Staff Writer
President Eisenhower indi
cated today he favors giving
businessmen, corporations and
investors the main share of
future tax relief.
This hint of administration
tax policy came in his annual
Text of Introduction and Outlook
Section of Report. Rage A-3
Economic Report to Congress,
predicting prosperity through
1960 and beyond if the Gov
ernment and private citizens
co-operate to avoid “excesses.”
Mr. Eisenhower said the
Government, should foster eco
nomic growth mainly by limit
ing spending and building up
budget surpluses to pay off
some of the national debt.
Business and labor, he said, can
do their part by increasing pro
ductivity and holding down
costs and prices.
To the general public he as
signed the task of buying care
fully and exercising vigilance.
Against Forcing Economy
Drawing the lines for elec
tion-year debate, the President
warned against pushing too
hard for fast economic growth.
“Appropriate measures should
be taken to restrain surges in
economic activity that might
lead to drastic corrections,” he
said, replying to critics who
contend the Government should
act more vigrously to accele
rate economic growth.
Without indicating when
taxes should be cut, the Pres
ident set forth these principles
for application when the time
comes:
""We must remain alert to
the possibility of making the
tax system a more effective
instrument for promoting eco
nomic growth. Taxes affect the
ability of individuals and corp
orations to save. Likewise, their
impact on the risk and return
of investment influences the
willingness to make productive
use of savings. Our tax system
should give encouragement to
productive effort and should
facilitate the mobility and ef
ficient use of capital. We should
continue to review out tax sys
tem from these standpoints, as
well as from the standpoint of
equity.”
Investing Over Spending
In the contex of past state
ments by high administration
officials, including Vice Presi
dent Nixon, this declaration
implies that tax reductions
[ should be designed more to en
courage business investment
than to promote consumer
spending.
Such a policy might call for
tax relief in the form of lib-

HONGKONG, China — Con
struction on a specialized hospital
for opium addicts is progressing.
The authorities estimate that this
growing problem has increased to
where there are now over 250,000
citizens partaking in this illegal
traffic.
Hongkong is the only remain
ing part of mainland China which
is still free. Yet, even if this area
is still free from the clutches of
the Peoples’ Government, how
free is it? How sad it is to be
held in such a vise, the vicious
habit of dope, which is the de
stroyer of both body and soul.
It is good that Hongkong is pro
viding a hospital for the treat
ment of these victim’s bodies. It
is also grand that the Lord has
provided for their souls’ need . . .
for the Light of the Gospel is
still shining in that area. There
are many missionaries and other
Christians residing there now,
who have left Red China. Surely
. . . The Saviour is still “able
alsci to save them to the uttermost
that come unto God by Him.”

Election Finance Changes
WASHINGTON — Senator
Gruening this week supported
two amendments to the bill,
S.2436, to revise the federal elec
tion laws, on the floor of the
Senate. The first of two amend
ments proposed by Sen. Thomas
C. Hennings Jr. (D-Mo), would
make it mandatory for campaign
contributors’ names and the
amounts they contributed in ex
cess of $1,000 to be declared in
primary elections as well as in
general elections. The amend
ment was adopted by a vote of 50
to 39. The second amendment in
cludes within the term “political
committee” any organization
which accepts, contributes, or
makes expenditures in excess of
$1,000 in any year to influence
election of candidates or presi
dential electors. The second
amendment was adopted by a vote
of 52 to 37. The vote on the bill
itself, to revise the federal elec
tion laws, the so-called “clean
elections bill,” was still to come.

2 Fishermen Lost
In Grays Harbor
Rescue Attempt
WESTPORT, Wash., UR — Tra
dition was tempered with tragedy
for a fishing boat and two of its
three crewmen on the storm
tossed Pacific Ocean off the
southwest Washington coast
Thursday night.
The fishermen stayed in dan
gerous, turbulent waters to aid
four Coast Guardsmen in a dis
abled patrol boat. The fishing
boat sank. Two of its crewmen
vanished into the churning sea.
The drama began when the
fishing vessel Barbara Lee called
tor help to get through huge
swells at the narrow entrance to
Grays Harbor. All day, winds up
to 55 miles an hour had raked
the coast.
The Coast Guard sent the 52
foot patrol boat Invincible to
guide the fishing boat across the
bar. It was a familiar procedure,
the Grays Harbor bar is treach
erous for small craft at all times.
Suddenly a monstrous wave
knocked the Invincible bottom
side up. The boat slowly righted,
but its engines were dead. One
of the four men aboard took a
bad cut.
The 30-foot Barbara Lee stood
by in the rain and wind. It threw
a line aboard the Invincible. The
line broke. It tried to attach
another.
Then a mountain of water en
gulfed the Barbara Lee. First the
fishing boat’s smokestack and an
tenna were swept away; then it
sank. The Invincible got one fish
erman, Harold Pernula of Cordo
va, aboard. The others, skipper
Robert Bolam, and crewman Ted
Sigardson, were nowhere to be
seen.
Two other Coast Guard boats
prowled the stormy waters in the
hope that the men might be found
bobbing about in life jackets. The
Coast Guard sent an airplane, but
foul weather forced it back. The
sheriff’s office ordered the beach
patrolled in case the men were
washed ashore.
The Coast Guard sent a larger
I boat, the cutter McLane, to take
I the Invincible in tow.

WASHINGTON, UP! — Senator
Gruening has strongly urged the

immediate action in transferring

declared not needed by the Alas
ka Air Command, in accordance
with recommendations recently
made to the secretary by Major

the needed equipment.
The Air Force has indicated it
might transfer, the planes to
Texas. However, under govern
ment regulations, the Air Force
has the authority to “giVe, lend

a matter of military support,

tary aircraft has not been yet
determined.

Protestants Protest
Kennedy Subject
To Papal Influence
NEW YORK, Iff) — Two major
Protestant magazines • say they
believe Sen. John Kennedy, if
elected President, would be sub
ject to restrictions of the Roman
Catholic Church.
The magazines, the Christian i
Century and the Lutheran, said
they base their view on the fact
that Kennedy had withdrawn in i
1951 from participation in an j
interfaith chapel service in Phil
adelphia. The magazines said the 1
withdrawal was made at the sug
gestion of the Catholic Archdio- j
cese there.
The chapel is a memorial to
four chaplains who lost their lives
in the torpedoing of a troop ship
off Greenland during World War
II.
The Christian Century said
Kennedy had declined to attend
the service on the ground that he
felt he had “no credentials” be
cause the Philadelphia Archdio
cese was unable to support the
chapel in the lower floor of a
Protestant Church.
The Lutheran said editorially
that if Kennedy became the Dem
ocratic Presidential nominee, the
religious debate would “follow
him into the White House, if he
should be elected.”
“His attendance at a Protestant
service would be cause for con
fession to his priest and subse
quent pennance,” the paper
added.

THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
A Back-door Third Term?
By ROBERT E. CLARK
Star Staff Writer
With debate on a proposal to
limit future Residents to two
terms nearing deadlock, the late
Senator Robert A. Taft arose on
the floor of the Senate in 1947 to
propose a compromise.
The language drafted personally
by the G. O. P.'s most-listened-to
voice in the Republican-led 80th
Congress became the Twenty
second Amendment to the Con
stitution of the United States.
With a jocular assist from
President Eisenhower, the words
chosen by Taft recently have
touched off the most spirited con
stitutional debate here since the
1955-57 argument over presiden
tial disability.
Could Mr. Eisenhower or any
two-term President barred from
re-election by the Twenty-second
Amendment—run for Vice Presi
dent? If he did and the new
President died or resigned, could
he succeed to the presidency and
serve the remaining part of a third
term?
Proposed in jest. Mr. Eisen
hower's hypothetical candidacy
has produced wide chuckles. But
the constitutional question is not
regarded as a joke.
House Study Ordered
Chairman Emanuel Celler of
the House Judiciary Committee
has quietly ordered a full staff
study of the matter. The Senate
Judiciary Committee’s Subcom
mittee on Constitutional Amend
ment hopes to use the is c ue to
strengthen suport for repeal of
the Twenty-second Amendment.

the office of President more than

closed TV and contributed more
than $5 million to the G. O. P
coffers.
The party faithful heard glow
ing things about the last seven*
years of Republican rule from
each of the three leaders But
they heard interesting differences
in approach, too. From one. a
defense: from another, a promise;
from the third, a challenge.
'Pessimists' Hit
Mr. Eisenhower’s address was
principally a defense of his ad
ministration. although he took the
occasion to blast “political mor
ticians” in the Democratic Party
who. he said, are ""exhibiting a
breast-beating pessimism in the
American system.""
The Vice President, who must
run on the record of the Eisen
hower administration, promised,
in effect, that he would not coast
on the accomplishments of the
past, if he were elected. ""We must
be proud of the record.” he as
serted. ""but we must do better.”
He titilated the liberal wing of
his party and many independent
voters with talk of extension of
social 'security, overhaul of our
""obsolete"" farm programs, areas
of chronic unemployment, inade
quate classrooms and underpaid
teachers
As for Mr. Rockefeller, his con
tribution was a challenge and an
admonition He said the G. O P.
needs more ""crusaders"" and
should, as a minority party, build
a broader base particularly
among women and youth.
The New York Governor, who
many persons believe is waiting
in the wings, ready to jump back
into the race for the nomination
if the opportunity presents itself,
warned that the Republicans could
not w’in on the ""Eisenhower her
itage"" alone.
Attacks on Nixon
While the Democratic presiden
tial hopefuls hunted doggedly for
an issue to challenge the G. O. P.
""peace and prosperity"" line, they
turned their guns on the person
ality of Mr. Nixon. At the Janu
ary 23 ""beauty contest” fund
ra.sing dinner in Washington, at
tended by all the aspirants except
Adlai Stevenson, the Vice Presi
dent was belted with vigor.
Senator Humphrey of Minnesota
led the way in the name-calling
department, referring tp Mr. Nixon
as a “juvenile delinquent” and a
""slicker.” Resentful Republican
Senators saw a chance to turn
the attacks against Mr. Nixon's
tormentors by accusing the Dem
ocrats of “low-road"" campaigning,
a charge often made in the past
against Mr. Nixon.
Meanwhile, the intra-party fight
among the Democrats produced
new indications of gains by Sen
ator Kennedy.
The Bostonian seemed assured
of Maryland's 24 convention votes
trhen Democratic Gov. Tawes last
week decided against running as
a “favorite son.” And the Senator
did well in several polls.
A check of Democratic National
Committeemen, taken jointly by

twice. . . .” These are the open
ing words of the amendment that
became part of the Constitution in
1951 after ratification by three
fourths of the States.
That seemed, to the 80th Con
gress, to be clear enough. But
is it?
The final sentence of the Twelfth
Amendment reads: “But no per
son constitutionally ineligible to
;he office of President shall be
eligible to that of Vice President
of the United States.”
This wording may also be sub
ject to a double interpretation.
The Twenty-second Amendment
bars election to a third term but
appears to leave open the possi
bility for a tw’o-term President to
succeed to the office through the
vice presidency. Some think this
loophole is closed by the Twelfth
Amendment, but the most expert
opinion seems to be on the other
side.
The Justice Department has in
formed President Eisenhower that
it would be “absolutely legal"" for
him to run for Vice President.
Legal, Says Department
“Ard that stopped it right
there, as far as I'm concerned.”
the President-still smiling—told
his news conference last week.
The unequivocal and unex
plained Justice Department opin
ion. however lightly expressed,
only served to inflame the argu
ment. But the view of the anony
mous Government lawyers is
given stout support by Edward S.
Corwin, professor emeritus at
Princeton University, who is re
garded by many as the foremost
authority on the Constitution.

Kennedy far out in front as the
man with ""the best chance” to
win the nomination. A private
poll, taken at his request, had
him the favorite candidate among
Democrats in Florida. And the
latest Gallup survey showed a
subs'antial increase in support

Other Candidates
The other Democratic candi
dates continued their busy pace
last week Senator Humphrey an
nounced he would vie for West
Virginia's 25 votes on Mav 10 and
challenged his opponents to do
likewise. But this primary is
merely a popularity contest, be
cause the delegates will not be
bound by the result.
Senators Johnson and Syming
ton lashed.out anew at Eisenhower
defense policies. Their attitudes
on civil rights legislation, how
ever, may be more meaningful in
their campaigns for the nomina
tion. Mr. Johnson insisted again
that a “good"" civil rights bill
would be passed this year. This
reportedly had his Southern sup
porters concerned Mr. Syming
ton, on the other hand, parried
questions on this controversial
subject during a trip to Dixie.
On Civil Rights:
Jockeying
Attorney General Rogers an
nounced a new plan to help
guarantee Negroes the right to
vote, as the civil rights issue
grew in Congress last week.
Although civil rights is im
portant. politically, to the Repub
lican Party, it is the most divisive
issue confronting the Democrats
as they prepare for the 1960 elec
tion campaign.
Congress is the stage upon
which the civil rights drama is be
ing played With the consensus
holding that some kind of legisla
tion will be passed before the
members pack oft for the conven
tion wars in July, serious jockey
ing by all factions is underway.
The most controversial item
this year is the plan to guarantee,
by Federal action, voting rights for
Negroes.
Last year, the Civil Rights Com
mission recommended a plan call
ing for presidential-appointed
Federal registrars who would act
as watchdogs to assure that Ne
groes are permitted to vote in Fed
eral elections.
Ths plan was not only opposed
by the Southern Democratic bloc;
President Eisenhower, the Justice
Department and others were
doubtful as to its constitutionality.
Nevertheless, the lines of battle
for and against the commission's
proposal wore being drawn when
to Prof. Corwin produced this legal
opinion:
""It would be perfectly constitu
tional for a two-term President to
run tor Vice President and to
succeed to the presidency again.
It is ridiculous to say that by
being President he has disquali
fied himself from eligibility as
Vice President.”
Prof. Corwin holds that the
12th Amendment has no bear
ing on the issue. He points out
that the seemingly pertinent sen
tence was intended only to extend
to the Vice President the consti
tutional requirements for the
presidency—to be at least 35 years
of age and a natural born citizen
who has lived within the United
States for 14 years.
Fowler Is Doubter
Bernard Fensterwald. counsel of
the Senate Subcommittee on Con
stitutional Amendment, agrees
with the Justice Department and
Prof. Corwin. There are some
doubters on the House Judiciary
Committee, however. Chairman
Celler does not consider the mat
ter to be this “cut and dried.""
Another doubter is Henry H.
Fowler, Washington attorney and
expert congressional witness on the
question of presidential disability.
“My view is that on a clear
reading and interpretation of the
22nd and 12th Amendments a
two-term President Is not eligible
to serve as Vice President.” he
said.
Didn’t anybody in the 80th Con
gress notice the loophole in the
language? Apparently not.
The amendment was debated
with bitter partisan rancor. Dem
ocrats regarded it as a posthu
mous insult to Franklin D. Roose

A Look at Algeria ...
The crisis in Algeria turns
the world's eyes upon a huge
section of North African moun
tains and desert land four times
the size of France.
Not since rebellion first flamed
in 1954 have Algerian ports,
mountain villages, and oases
seemed so remote from boule
vards of Paris.
Frenchmen have long thought
of Algeria as an extension of
Gallic soil, not as a colonial
outpost. The dazzling white
capital. Algiers, is less than two
hours by plane from the French
coast. The populous northern
division elects deputies to the
French National Assembly as
though it were a part of the
mainland.
French foods stock Algerian
cases and shops Colons own
much arable land They control
the wine production that makes
up so heady a share of Algeria’s
export trade.
Though nine out of ten Al
gerians are Arab or Berber,
their country has a deeply
rooted French culture. Once a
part of anarchic Barbary. Al
geria was occupied by France in
1830. given a name and a na
tional entity.
Algeria is a vast country of
862 781 square miles, relatively
underdeveloped but with po
tential oil and mineral wealth.
Time's attrition has turned
much of it into a lifeless ocean
of wind-carved sands and jagged
mountains. As a whole the
country is sparsely populated.
Most of Algeria's 9.5 million
people live in the Tell. This fer
tile strip of coastal hills and
valleys forms a green garden
stretching some 600 miles be
tween Morocco and Tunisia.
Compressed into the Tell are
Attorney General Rogers made a
surprise announcement.
He had a new approach to the
same problem, one which ho felt
would get around the constitu
tionality issue. His plan would
charge Federal judges with the
responsibility of appointing “ref
erees’* to see to it that qualified
voters were actually permitted to
cast their ballots in State as
well as in Federal elections. The
referees also would act to see
that registration of voters is con
ducted fairly.
The Rogers plan caused a bit
of uncertainty among backers of
a strong civil rights measure.
Many of them now were not sure
which they like better—the com
mission's approach or the At
torney General’s
Northern Democratic liberals
were particularly on the spot be
cause in some ways the Rogers
plan was stronger than the com
mission's. To back the Attorney
General's proposal would mean
giving the Republicans credit for
meaningful civil rights action in
the presidential election year. And.
as everyone knows, the all-but
certain Republican nominee, Vice
President Nixon, is a close per
sonal friend of Mr. Rogers. Mr.
Rogers let it be known that Mr.
bate to eulogies of his four terms.
Republicans were concentrating
on party unity—not one G. O. P.
member of the House or Senate
voted against the amendment.
As it originally passed the House
the resolution stated that anyone
who had ""served"" twice as Presi
dent would be ineligible to an
other term. The version sent to
the Senate floor by the Judiciary
Committee would have barred a
third term to anyone who had
“held” the office twice.
With this language there prob
ably would have been no confu
sion. But there was much argu
ment in the Senate over the pro
vision covering a Vice President
who served out part of a presi
dential term. Senator Taft offered
his compromise with the key word
changed to “elected” a few hours
before the Anal vote.
The Senate Insisted dn the Taft
language and the House accepted
the altered form.
The Senate Subcommittee on
Constitutional Amendment does
not regard the possibility of a
President “sneaking” back into
office for a third term as purely
hypothetical. In a national crisis,
a staff member noted, there could
be heavy pressure for a President
to stay on for a third term, as
there was with Roosevelt in 1940.
He might agree to run as Vice
President with a “stand-in” who
would resign after the election.
Third Term Pressure
What would happen if a two
term President actually won nom
ination as Vice President?
Thurman Arnold, who has been
a judge on the United States Court
of Appeals, an Assistant Attorney
General, a law professor—and a
student of Prof. Corwin—says it
would probably work this way:
Nothing could be done legally to
stop the candidate in advance of
the election. Congress, which tal
lies the electoral vote, could keep
him from office by refusing to
recognize his votes as valid. But if
he were permitted to take office
as Vice President there could be
no effective court challenge un
less he succeeded to the presi
dency.
When he began signing bills as
President, a court case could be
brought on grounds that he was
holding office unconstitutionally.
But Judge Arnold believes the case
would collapse and the United
States would have another third
term President.
“I'd give you about 25-to-l that
the Supreme Court would call it
a political question not within its
jurisdiction.” he said. “I think
they'd dodge that one like a hot
potato.""
Algeria's food basket and its
cities. These include Algiers,
with broad avenues and arcaded
buildings on the harbor and
modern apartment buildings
climbing into the hills. Oran is
a cosmopolitan port with roads
converging upon it from all di
rections: Constantine, an inland
city built on a great rock about
2.100 feet above sea level.
In the Tell are farmlands
lush with grape, olive, fig and
orange groves. Chill winter
rains bring life to Algerian soil
and interrupt the oppressive
heat of summer. Far to the
south are Algeria's snow-capped
peaks.
Chains of the Atlas Mountains
rise all the way across the coun
try, and for most Algerians,
deeply rooted in the Tel), the
distant barriers seem unreal.
These are the homes of tribes
men who grow some grain but
mostly live solitary, nomadic
lives. Their goats, sheep and
camels forage for alfalfa and
esparto grass on the windy, high
plateaus.
Beyond is Algeria's empty
quarter. Bleak territories of the
Algerian Sahara cover an ex
panse three times greater than
Texas and reach far down into
the continent to touch French
West Africa.
Alger.a's hope of an El Dorado
for its growing population—
there is a yearly increase of
250 GOO—lies in this sea of sand
and rock. Oil. coal, iron, man
aganese, and tungsten have been
found. France has been formu
lating a multibillion-dollar eco
nomic development program
even in the atmosphere of un
resolved war.
(The National Gcngrephlc Society)
Nixon had approved the plan be
fore it was publicly announced.
As for the Southern wing of the
Democratic Party, it was ready to
fight, to the end against either
plan, although the appointment
of local persons by a Federal judge
may seem less objectional than
""registrars"" named by the Presi
dent. Senator Talmadgc of Geor
gia called the Rogers proposal an
exhumation of an “unspeakable”
Reconstruction Era law.
The Southern attitude presents
a terrifically difficult problem for
Senate Majority Leader Lyndon
Johnson. His main support in his
unavowed campaign for the Dem
ocratic presidential nomination
comes from the South. Yet he has
pledged his support of a “good”
civil rights bill and has expressed
a strong belief that the rights of
qualified voters must be protected
in every State.
On the House side, the Rules
Committee, which has had a mod
erate Judiciary Committee civil
rights bill bottled up since last
August, will meet tomorrow. An
indication of how long it might
take for this measure to reach
the floor, and whether amend
ments to it will be permitted, may
be had at that time.

Conflicting Textile Policies
Plague U. S. Manufacturers
By SHIRLEY SCHF.IBLA
Contributing Writer
The Departments of State and
Agriculture are weaving trouble
for the administration by exer
cising two contrary policies on
cotton.
The Agriculture Department’s
aid to cotton growers keeps prices
high. This brings about great out
put, which results in turn in
cotton surpluses. To keep the
surpluses from becoming unman
ageable, the Government has im
port quotas to keep out ""cheap”
foreign cotton and export subsidies
to get rid of surplus domestic
cotton.
The state Department, on the
other hand, wants to free world
trade channels bv making mutu
ally beneficial agreements with
other countries to end all artificial
restrictions ion trade. It hopes
to pursue this aim activelv when
negotiations open in September
in Geneva with the member na
tions of the Genera’ Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT>.
This department believes that the
United States has more to gain
than to lose because it is the
vic'im of more restrictions than
it carries out itself.
The trade philosophies of these
departments have clashed on other
commodities as well, notably on
wool. In addition, the United
States has a GATT waiver which
enables it to restrict the quantities
of imports of dairy products,
grains and Dutch cheese.
Manufacturers Alarmed
The cotton manufacturers in
this country contend that agree
ments such as the State Depart
ment wants would be disastrous
for them. They not only are
working hard to head off any such
developments, but are actively
proposing further restrictions on
cotton textile trade. They claim
they are at a disadvantage in
international competition because
they are forced to buy high-priced
American cotton.
Foreign mills, on the other hand
in addition to buying ""cheap”
foreign cotton, can buy American
cotton at eight cents a pound
cheaper than the price paid by

Atom Test Ban:
No 'Partials'
Last week the American dele
gation at the Geneva conference
on ways and means of ending
nuclear weapons tests prepared
to offer a compromise. In effect,
a partial ban would be agreed
upon, with large underground
tests barred but small tests un
checked. On Wednesday, before
the proposal had been presented
formally to the conference, the
Soviet delegation rejected it.
For almost 16 months repre
sentatives of the Soviet Union, the
United States and the United
Kingdom have been talking at
Geneva on a world-wide cessation
of nuclear testing. Their progress
has been measured in inches; the
chief result to date has been only
that no nation has resumed test
ing in the absence of an agreement.
Some hurdles have been scaled
successfully. But the present dif
ficulty appears the toughest, of all
to date: American and British
contentions that nuclear tests can
be conducted underground with
little risk of detection are chal
lenged by the Russians, who Insist
that the issue was raised merely
as a device to head off a work
able test ban.
In a new effort to break the
log jam, the United States chief
delegate, James J. Wadsworth, was
ready last week to propose that
large underground tests be banned
but that small ones be permitted
until there was reasonable assur
ance that detection methods were
adequate to check them.
“Ersatz,"" said the Soviet chief
delegate, Semyon K. Tsarapkin,
when told of the compromise pro
posal by reporters. “Nonsense and
totally unacceptable.” he added
later after talking with Mr. Wads
worth. Only a complete and all
inclusive ban would be acceptable
to Moscow, he said, reminding the
reporters that the United States
United States manufacturers,
thanks to an Agriculture Depart
ment export subsidy of that
amount.
Domestic manufacturers don't
want to see this American cotton
come back here to give them com
petition in the form of finished
cotton. Actually, however, they do
not appear to be suffering any
substantial damage at the moment.
Despite recent increases, im
ports of cotton goods are running
at a rate equal to only about
three per cent of American pro
duction. Mill profits are high.
Confronted with these facts, the
manufacturers say they want Gov
ernment protection against future
trouble. They say they are alarmed
over the upward trend in imports
of cottons. The industry here is
noted for its cyclical ups and
downs. Its representatives claim
an increase in imports during a
“down period” could spell real
trouble.
Through the Commerce De
partment they already have suc
ceeded in persuading Japan to
limit voluntarily its exports of
cotton goods to the United States
under a highly complex formula
Japan knew it faced the prospect
of mandatory controls if it didn’t
institute voluntary ones.
Hong Kong Efforts
Now the Commerce Department
is trying to do the same thing
with Hong Kong but without the
same success. Henry Kearns. As
sistant Secretary of Commerce for
International Affairs, has traveled
twice to Hong Kong recently to
discuss voluntary export quotas.
Hong Kong has proposed volun
tary quotas on garments only,
not textiles, and it has said it
would only limit 1960 garment
exports to a 15 per cent increase
over 1959.
Neither Mr. Kearns nor the
American mill owners are pleased
with this suggestion. Perhaps the
most disconcerted party, however,
is Japan. The Japanese have in
formed the United States Govern
ment that they are unhappy over
the Hong Kong situation and do
not intend to continue their
had voted in the United Nations
General Assembly for a complete
ban.
Curious Cuba:
Resoite for U. S.
On Tuesday President Eisen
hower reaffirmed his policy of
""no reprisals” against Cuba for
Castro attacks and expropria
tions. Whether in response or
not, Cuban speakers and news
papers suddenly eeased their
daily blasts at I’ncle Sam.
It was possible in Havana, for
the first time since January of
1958. to read a newspaper or lis
ten to a radio speech by a Castro
official without encountering a
savage blistering of Yankee im
perialism. The guns were silent.
There was no way of knowing
whether the silence was perma
nent or even deliberate. But it
was real.
At his news conference on Tues
day, President Eisenhower was
asked about his intentions toward
the Castro regime. The emotional
Cuban revolutionary's speeches
had been growing ever more viru
lent, and he was being echoed by
his Minister of Justice and othei
high officials.
Would the tlnited States slash
the Cuban sugar quota in retalia
tion for Cuban attacks on the
United States and for expropria
tion of American holdings? No,
said Mr. Eisenhower.
Ready for the question, the
President read to the reporters a
formal statement that was ob
viously designed (1) to reassure
the people of Cuba on American
good intentions, and <2> to place
the thorny Cuban issue in the
open, especailly for the edifica
tion of other Latin American
nations. In it he warned Cuba,
and indirectly other nations of
the Western Hemisphere, that it
was necessary “to recognize and
defeat the intrigues of interna
tional communism which are
aimed at destroying democratic
institutions in Cuba and the tra
ditional and mutually beneficial
friendship between the Cuban and
American peoples.”
voluntary quotas unless Hong
Kong institutes similar ones.
Hong Kong has performed the
incredible feat of increasing cot
ton textile exports from 2.347,000
square yards in 1958 to 27,884,000
square yards in 1959.
Cotton textile makers here also
are concerned about the trend
in other Asian exports, India's
exports have gone from 1,274,000
square yards in 1958 to 14,335,000
in 1959. Formosa’s have gone from
167,000 in 1958 to 6,509,000 in 1959,
For Pakistan the export jump is
from 28.000 in 1958 to 5.782,000
in 1959, and for Korea it is from
4,793.000 in 1958 to 5.751,000 in
1959.
The ultimate aim of the cotton
cloth makers is to obtain manda
tory quotes limiting the quantity
of imports by categories of goods,
making quotas most restrictive for
lines most directly competitive
with American cottons.
Quotes Are Asked
Early this month the Commerce
Department’s Textile Advisory
Committee called for such quotas.
The only public representative on
the committee abstained from the
recommendation. He is Martin
Gainsbrueh of the National In
dustrial Conference Board.
While it appears that' the in
distry won't get such quotas in
the near future, its representatives
feel they are making progress in
the direction of protectionism.
Their greatest coup has been their
success in persuading the White
House to investigate the advisa
bility of increasing present tariffs.
President Eisenhower has di
rected the Tariff Commission to
make an investigation to deter
mine whether this is so. In his
communication to the commission,
the President said he had been
advised by the Secretary of Ag
riculture that export subsidies are
a loss to the extent of imports to
the United States.
The cost of the cotton export
subsidy program from its inception
in 1956 through the current mar
keting year is estimated at $7OO
million. The amount of the subsidy
varies each year.
For the 1956-7 marketing year
the Agriculture Department's
Commodity Credit Corporation
paid a subsidy of 6'2 cents a
pound on 7.6 million bales of cot
ton for a total cost of $241 million.
The following year the subsidy was
reduced to 5 cents a pound, and
exports under it dropped to 5.7
million bales. The export drop re
sulted in the subsidy being re
stored to 6’-2 cents for the fol
lowing year, when it failed to boost
exports. Instead they dropped to
2.8 million bales, and subsidy pay
ments, though at the original rate,
totaled only $9l million.
For the 1959-60 marketing year
the rate has been boosted to a
record 8 cents a pound. Agricul
ture Department officials expect
exports to total 5.5 million bales
for a subsidy cost of $220 million.
Financing Subsidy Plan
Obviously the Agriculture De
partment is interested in cotton
textile tariffs as a means of fi
nancing its multi - million - dollar
export subsidy program. The cot
ton manufacturers, however, look
upon a tariff as a step along the
road of protectionism which they
hope will lead to quotas limiting
quanities of imports.
They reason that levying of new
cotton textile duties would be at
least a tacit acknowledgment of
a need for curtailment of imports.
They then explain that when it
becomes obvious that tariffs will
not do this, then a further step
mav be taken.
The mill representatives think
it is a hopeful sign that they have
been able to get .their product di
rectly associated with the agri
cultural program. Because farm
blocs are powerful the world over,
the move tq free restrictions on
trade is expected to exempt agri
cultural products.

""STEEL PACT GAINS ARE EXAGGERATED""
By Sylvia Porter, Free Press 1-19
How have you and your family made out financially
in the last 10 years of climbing prices? Have you kept ahead
of or slipped behind the risinc cost of living?
You have made out very well if you're a typical worker
living in an American city—very well indeed.
You have kept far ahead of the rising cost of living be
cause your paycheck has jumped higher than the price
level.
YOU ARE PAYING FOR JUST ABOUT TYPE OF GOODS
AND SERVICES WHICH YOU MUST OR WANT TO BUY—
BUT YOU HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE MONEY WITH
WHICH TO PAY FOR THE GOODS AND SERVICES.
In New York City, for instance, the consumer price
level—by which we measure changes in the cost of living
has increased 23 per cent since 1950. But weekly earnings
of New York's factory workers have increased 39 per cent
and weekly earnings of office workers also have risen sharp
ly. For women clerical office workers, as a whole, the pay
rise in the decade has been a fat 56 per cent.

N.Y. Trib. 1-17
The facts behind the steel strike settlement are not all
as they have been presented either by David J. McDonald,
president of the United Steel Workers of America, or by
Paul M. Butler, Democratic national chairman. Mr. Butler
deliberately misled the public in his Monday-morning
quarterback's statements about the role of Vice-President
Nixon in effecting an end to the nation's most costly and
crippling strike.

Seeks Stature To Ban
State School Problems
ALBANY N. Y. Testifying before the New York State
Senate committee on Public Health here this week. Jack
E Wood NAACP special assistant for housing, called for
pariv enactment of the Metcalf-Baker bill banning racial
discrimination in the sale or rental of private dwellings
throughout the state.
Existing state legislation, he
pointed out, ""covers only 5 per
cent of the housing market.” in
that it is restricted to publicly
aided housing. The Metcalf-
Baker bill would extend this
coverage in an effort to provide
“a free and open housing mar
ket equally to all American citi
zens without restrictions.
Further, Mr. Wood charged
that “urban renewal and rede
velopment programs arc being
planned and executed through
out New York which threaten
to create new and lasting pat
terns of segregated housing. The
SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1900
Cut Dixie Representation
Suggested By Race Leader
NEW YORK NAACP Executive Secretary Roy Wil
kins said here this week that “if the South remains stub
born on Negro disfranchisement, disadvantaged Northern
states ought to insist on a cut in Congressional representa
tion” from Southern states denying Negro voting rights.
“This step would decrease
Dixie House members by 20 to
25 per cent and clothe them, so
to speak, in the proper size
britches.” Mr. Wilkins added.
The NAACP chief executive
spoke on “Freedom. Franchise
and Segregation” at a forum cele
brating the centennial of the
founding of Cooper Union for
the Advancement of Science and
Art. He spoke in the same Great
Hall that housed the mass meet
ing 51 years ago, that helped
bring the NAACP into being. It
is also the hall in which Abra
ham Lincoln made his famous
address on Feb. 27, 1859 vindi
cating the principles of the new
Republician part'
Mr. Wilkins pointed out that
disfranchisement of citizens of
both races allows Southern
congressmen and senators to be
elected and re-elected through
their one-party system.
Their resulting ""seniority gives
them a disproportionately pow
eriill influence on the nation’s
legislative business,” Mr. Wiilkins
said.
“When the Democratic party
is in control of* Congress, they
become chairmen of most of the
committees, 'as they are in this
session.
“Not content with protecting
their own brand ot apartheid
hack home, they arc not hesitant
to demand extent ion of their
racial philosophy and practices
to the rest of the nation,” Mr.
Wilkins said.
“In general,” Secretary Wil
kins continued “the Negro tends
to vote according to his interest
as a citizen and only secondarily
(barring a hot racial issue) as
a Negro.
“Negro citizens arc interested
in national defense, foreign al
lairs, taxes, health and welfare,
cost of living, education, jobs
and wages, as arc other Ameri
cans.
“They arc also interested in
civil rights, in attacking preju
dice and bigotry in American
life,"" Mr. Wilkins said.
As of today, he asserted, ""no
one can predict exactly what
the Negro voter will do on
election day."" However, ""he
does not like much of what he
sees in the behavior of either
party.""
Ho reported that ""only ti'o
Southern states still retain the
intellectual and economic con
tribution by thousands of Ne
groes to the cultural and .iidus
trial development of this state
has been severely restricted,""
because of their inability to se
cure adequate housing.
Housing, he told the legisla
tors, is “a key civil rights is
sue.” lie expressed the hope
that Governor Nelson A. Rocke
feller and the “1960 legislature
will exercise the same forceful
leadership to secure the moral
and social well-being of the peo
ple of New Yoi*k as they have
devoted to the problems of in
come and budget.”
poll tax as a prerequisite to vot
ing—Virginia, Alabama. Arkan
sas, Texas and Mississippi.
“But,"" he added, ""other devices
are effective in barring Negro
citizens from the ballot box.
“No wonder.” Secretary Wiil
kins added, ""that on a South
wide basis, only 25 per cent of
the Negro citizens ot voting age
are registered.
""There are wide variations be
tween states and still wider vari

MODERN DRESS FOR NUNS
Wearing their modern attire as they walk outside Holy Ghost School in
Pittsburgh are Sisters Matthew, John and Mark of the new order of
Catholic Sisters of Christ the Teacher. The new dress consists of a
navy blue two-piece suit, white blouse, flared skirt, pill box hat and
pump-style shoes. The sisters will be the first nuns of the Byzantine
(Greek) Catholic Church in modern garb.—AP Wirephoto.
$49 Million Cut in Aid
Voted by House Group
By the Associated Press
The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted today to cut
>49 million from President Eisenhowers request for special
economic aid to certain military allies.
The action would reduce the defense support total in the
over-all $4,125,000,000 foreign
$724 million .to $675 million I
million for such aid. However,
the administration request this
year was substantially smaller
than last year’s.
The defense support fund is
used for special grants to coun
tries maintaining, for common
defense, military forces out of
proportion to their economies.
Asiatic allies are the main
recipients.
The committee recessed for
the week end without voting on
any other parts of the bill.
Chairman Morgan. Democrat.
Pennsylvania said it expects to
finish its work and send a bill
to the House next week.
Held Disarmament Peri!
A State Department spokes- 1
man said that if drastic cuts
are made in military aid abroad
achievement of a genuine dis
armament agreement with Rus- ■
sia ""would become a pipe
dream.” .
Foy D. Kohler. Assistant Sec
retary of State, told the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee that with the summit I
conference approaching, main
taining the strength of NATOs
allies in Europe is more im- 1
portant than at any time since .
the alliance was founded.
He testified at a closed ses
sion after Senator Church.
Democrat, Idaho, a committee
member, announced he will
fight to cut $2OO million from
President Eisenhower's request
for $2 billion in military as
sistance funds in the over-all
$4,175,000,000 program.
Hits *Blank Check’
Senator Church announced
he will offer an amendment
to the big foreign aid bill to
repeal what he called the
“blank check” authorization I
Congress voted last year for
arms aid abroad. He proposed
Instead a ceiling of $l.B billion
on appropriations for the fiscal
year starting July 1.
""Actually."" Senator Church
told a reporter, “this would not
effect a cut below current
levels of military aid spending
but would prevent an increase
in current levels.”
Congress last year authorized
no-ceiling appropriations for
military assistance for the fis
cal years starting July 1, 1960,
and July 1, 1961. Congress still

Burns in Jersey
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J.. Mar.
j 24 <APi.—A seven-story hotel
was a collapsed mound of ruin
today after a general alarm fire
' that for a time threatened two
other hotels.
The fire yesterday destroyed
the 200-room Wiltshire Hotel
near the Boardwalk. Two fire
men were Injured.
Occupants were evacuated
from the Governor and Morton

Stassen Urges i
Acceptance of i
Soviet Proposal
Harold E. Stassen, former <
disarmament aide to President
Eisenhower, said today the 1
United States should accept '
Russia’s proposal for an in- <
formal moratorium on under- <
ground nuclear tests, at least
temporarily, so the world ""can IJ
move forward” on disarma
ment.
Mr. Stassen said in a tele
phone interview that the mora
torium “is a reasonable price
to pay to get what is a big
gain"" in the search for away
to disarm.
The Russians have suggested
that the East and West enter
into a treaty which would ban 1
all big nuclear tests, above and
below ground, with a com
panion “honor system” agree-!
ment that would prohibit un
derground tests of any size for
about five years.
Disputes Anderson
<
Mr. Stassen took issue with
Senator Anderson of New •
Mexico, who heads the House-
Senate Atomic Energy Com
mittee. The Senator has called
the Russian proposal a “pig in
a poke” and has declared the
United States cannot enter
into a moratorium agreement
without an adequate inspection
system to make sure there is
no cheating.
Senator Anderson, Mr. Stas
sen said, “doesn’t weigh the
total picture which is how to
decrease the likelihood of get
ting nuclear weapons in many
many hands."" The spread of
these weapons increases the
chances of mankind suffering
the ""catastrophic” consequences
of a nuclear war, he added.
Mr. Stassen said he assumed'

said these tests should be con

observation.
More Called Significant
The moratorium offer. Mr.
1 Stassen contended, “is the most
i significant move since the Rus
sian concession in June. 1957,
When they agreed to accept in
spection. . . . There is a better
chance now than any time
since the first atomic bomb
went off"" to reach agreement
on testing.
Mr. Stassen said the bright
ened picture stemmed from
Russia s moratorium proposal
; and the impending summit
I meeting. He declared these
; factors promised to result this
year in ""a first-step agreement""
with the Russians on nuclear
tests.
. “It is so important to get
started on control and inspec
tion,” he said, “that it is worth
making some concession on the
moratorium.”

11 Senator HumpJjrey, Democrat

■ the Senate that a com-

banning nuclear tests may be
in sight.
Senator Humphrey, chairman

J “The Soviet Union must be

United States must be willing
to accept a moratorium on

designated period pending the
outcome of the research pro

Federal Aid Bills
The U.S. Senate recently passed S. 8 calling for
edcral education grants for construction and salaries
of over $1,800,000,000.00 but only for public schools.
And now the Mouse of Representatives is preparing to
debate and vote on II. R. 10128 which provides for con
struction grants of $975,000,*
federal aid legislation is en
act cd at this session of Con
gross, it may well come about
thai the private and paro
chial schools will be spent
out of existence by all-pur
pose federal grants in the
years to come.
000.00 also only to the public
schooli
Both s 8 and H. R. 10128
discriminate against those
children who attend private
and parochial schools. Fur
thermore, in violation ol' the
clear intent ol the First
Amendment, they reduce to
second-class status those citi
zens who through conscience
prefer religious education by
cutting them of/ from general
federal funds.
I most strongly urge those
who believe that all children
are entitled to American fair
play and the equal protection
Of the laws to write, wire or
perhaps even phone their Con
gressman (House Office Build
ing, Washington, D. C.) and
their Senators (Senate Office
Building, Washington, D. C.).
Now is the time to protest

along a path that seemed in
exorable.""
The editorial said that

St. Vincent de Paul Society, Msgr. Raymond Schroder,
director of the Catholic Charities of Dayton told the
Diocesan St. Vincent de Paul members at their annual
meeting, Sunday at the Fort

Monsignor Schroder who is

men that they must ""take the
flame of the love of Christ
and rekindle that love in
every association they make.""
""OUR ST. VINCENT de

The main concern of today's
father is not to struggle day
after day to fill empty stom
achs, Msgr. Irving A. DeBlanc,
director of the Family Life
Bureau, National Catholic
Welfare Conference, said
here.
""He has a more important
function,"" he told couples at
tending the Pittsburgh Dioce
san Family Life Conference,
""which is to be a good relig
ious leader and good educa
tor.""
""He must present to his
household a complete picture
of the Father in Heaven,""
Msgr. DeBlanc continued.
""As the Father is wise, so
ihust he be as the Father is
efficient, so must he be as
the Father is merciful and un-*
derstanding and loving, so
must he be.""
Msgr. DeBlanc stressed that
the right kind of a wife helps
man to be the right kind of
a father. 4
""Children do not need an
other mother,"" he added.
""One is enough. They must
have an aggressive protective
father, one who is able and
willing to defend and fight
for his family. He must be
identified with strength.""
Msgr. DeBlanc scored the
tendency to drain fatherhood
of maleness. ""We need a sure
father pattern."" he said. ""He
is not to be an authoritative
tyrant he is not to be a nam
by-pamby, mother substitute.
The father is to be firm with
out being despotic, decisive
without being dictatorial, gen
tle and yet not weak.""

members of Kenya’s thirty other
tribes on the other side.
The Kigruyu alone total more
than 1,500,000. They inhabit Ken
ya’s richly agricultural Central
Province in the vicinity of Nair
obi and have been politically con
scious for nearly forty years. It
was the Kikuyu who spawned the
Mau Mau rebillion that held Ken
ya in the grip of terror from 1952
to 1956.
Closely allied with the Kikuyu
are their cousins and neighbors
in Central Province, the Embu
and Meru, who number more than
500,000.
Leaders Work Together
In the jockeying for power that
has followed the Lancaster House
meetings, the leaders ow the Kik
uyu and Luo tribes have tended
to work together. There are more
than 800,000 Luo, whose home is
swampy Nayanza Province on the
shores of Lake Victoria.
Tom Mboya, probably Kenya’s
best-known African politician, is
a Luo. However, he depends to a
large extent on Kikuyu support.
The recently formed Kenya
African National Union, which is
seeking official recognition aa a
colony-wide African political or
ganization, is princpally an all
iance of Kikuyu and Luo politic
ians.
What the other tribes fear is
that the Kikuyu and Luo will
dominate the coming African gov
ernment of Kenya and dictate to
the other tribes.
In the last week public signs
of concern began to appear. Two
groups of Kenya’s former war
I rior tribes rejected affiliation with
the Kenya African National Un
ion.
One was the Kalenjin Political
Alliance, which is composed of
the Nandi, Kipsigis, Baringo, Sulk,
Elgevo and Tugen tribes, which
are bound together by the common
language of Kalenjin.
The other was the Masai Unit
ed Front, which in a nallianee of

The Belgian Congo is scheduled
to achieve independence June 30
Eight tribesmen were slain in
renewed clashes between the Lulua
and the Baluba in Kasai Province
last night.
The fighting was heaviest at
Luebo. There Lulua seeking to
drive all Baluba from the city
raided the Baluba quarter with
machetes and spears, killing three
Baluba and injuring one.
A Baluba counter-attack result
ed in the slaying of two Lulua and
injuries to seven. Fifty-eight huts
were burned. Later, in the pro
vincial capital of Luluabourg, three
Lulua were slain by the Baluba
and twenty injured.
Mr. Kasavubu, usually consid
ered the most modeate of the Con- •
golese nationalist leaders, said the |
Belgians had flouted international
law by supporting Lulua demands
for the ouster of the Baluba from
western Kasai.
The Lulua contend that the
smarter and more aggressive Ba
luba are foreigners on the Lulua
tribal lands and have threatened
to massacre all Baluba who resist
evacuation. The Belgian author
ities took the position that any
Baluba remaining on Lulua lands
would have to bow to Lulua tribal
law.
“The Belgians are more foreign
than the Baluba, yet they support- :
ed Lulua demands that the Baluba'
when it seemed headed for defeat,
vubu commented. “It is against
international law. Why, in the
United States all sorts of people
of different nationalities live to
gether and nobody tries to sepa
rate them.”
Mr. Kasavubu is a member of
the six-man Congolose advisory
group that is supposed to share
power with the Belgian Govern
or General until independence. Mr.
Kasavubu said that on a recent
visit to Kasai the group called a
halt to evacuation of the Baluba
but the order was thwarted by the
Belgian provincial administration.
Mr. Kasavubu dismissed as “bad
Belgian propaganda” reports that
he and his Association of the Low
er Congo, known as ABAKO, had
had merely become “panicky” be
fore the District Attorney and that
this was not enough to justify
a charge of conspiracy, since Mr.
Jack’s statements had been un
sworn.
Mr. Davidson also maintained
that the indictment was faulty in
failing to specify that Mr. Jack

the real estate operator wos involv
ed with the city.
A third objection was that the
conspiracy count and the three
allegations of accepting illegal
gifts could not be joined in a
single indictment.

interest loans for construction by
private and parochial schools.
The American Jewish Congress
spokesman said his organization
supported an effective Federal
school-construction bill because the
present needs of our public schools
can no longer be met by local re
sources."" He warned, however
that widening the scope of the bill
to include loans for private schools,
including church institutions, was
""dangerous” on two grounds.
First, he said, the Zablocki a
mendment would permit Federal
funds to be used to frustrate the
Supreme Court’s decision outlaw
ing racial segregation in the pub
lic schools.
“In view of the threat by many
Southern communities to abolish
their public school systems rather
than desegregate,"" Mr’. Folier de
clared, “the Zablocki amendment
offers a way for Southern school
officials to have their cake and eat
it too. They would simply close
up their local public schools, set
up private schools and apply to
to build them with.”
the Federal government for loans
The result, he said, would be to
nullify the Supreme Court school
desegregation decision.
Second, the Zablocki amendment
presents a “grave threat to re
ligious freedom and the separation
of church and state by opening
the door to Federal aid to church
schools, in violation of the Con
stitution,” Mr. Polier declared
adding:
“Just as church groups may not
be interfered with by the state
neither may they be supported by
the state. The Zablocki amend
ment challenges one of the basic
precepts of our American demo
cratic tradition—that the relation
between man and his God is im
mutably private and personal, and
under our Constitution may neither
be the subject of governmental !
control nor the beneficiary of gov
ernmental support.”

Kennedy Takes It All
When the end came, It looked easy.
Duj-lng the long day and night the
men who were to lose, or their spokes
men, stood sturdily by their claims.
Senator Kennedy, they said, didn’t have
the votes to go over on the first ballot.
His support would begin to ebb if he
didn’t make it on the second. Then, or
so the claims went, the race would be
wide open and anything could happen.
The nominating speeches, innocent
of anything resembling a fresh thought,
and the dreary demonstrations dragged
along. From time to time something
popped up to relieve the monotony.
Senator Symington had to deny a broad
cast rumor that he was going to with
draw in favor of Senator Kennedy. A
similar report was denied by a spokes
man for Senator Johnson. When Adlai
Stevenson’s name was put in nomina
tion the demonstration for him was
long, loud and appeared to be more
or less spontaneous. Most of the noise
may have come from the Stevenson
rooters who had no votes, but the show
was fervent enough to encourage a be
lief that maybe something was in the
works after all.
It was a mood that was not to
last long. Senator Kennedy began to
pull away soon after the first ballot
began. Senator Symington and Mr.
Stevenson were never in the race. Lyn
don Johnson, who had shown signs of
desperation earlier in the day, moved
past the 400 mark, but he never came
close to the 500 or more votes which
he had predicted for himself. As it
happened, Wyoming cast the ballots
which brought the winner up to the
magic number—76l. At the end of the
roll call Senator Kennedy had 806. Then
the delegates made it unanimous Sen
ator Johnson, who had given up and
gone to bed, put out a statement con
gratulating the winner and promising
full support in the election campaign.
Senator Kennedy, accompanied by his
mother, a sister and friends, came down
to the convention hall, where he made
a little talk promising to carry the bat
tle to the enemy and appealing for the
support of a united party. Then, in
the early hours, he left for what was
described as a conference with vice
presidential prospects. The battle was
over and the 43-year-old great grand
son of a penniless Irish Immigrant,
who left Ireland to escape the famine,
had emerged as the Democratic Party’s
choice for the White House, for an
office of enormous responsibilities, an
office upon which ride the hopes of
our own country and the whole free
world.
What kind of man is this youthful
candidate? And why did the conven
tion turn to him—the youngest and
the least experienced of the party’s
four major aspirants?
The Kennedy image has become
familiar to most people through his
televised appearances. And it will be
come better known as the campaign
moves along. He is articulate, intelli
gent, poised and blessed with a talent
for winning friends instead of alienat
ing people. If there are doubts that
Mr. Kennedy is old enough and rugged
enough to stand up to Mr. Khrushchev,
this young man may still prove harder
and tougher than one might think.
The second question is easier. Su
perior organization, months of very hard
work, the Kennedy money—all of these
went into the successful pre-convention
campaign. But above all else the Mas
sachusetts Senator had stamped him
self in the minds of the delegates as
a winner. Os the four real aspirants
last night, Senator Kennedy—and only
Senator Kennedy—had gone into the
primaries and demonstrated that he
had voter appeal. In Wisconsin he de
feated Senator Humphrey and displayed
some strength with the farmers. In
West Virginia he again trounced the
Minnesota Senator and, more impor
tantly, he showed he could win in a
State with a negligible Catholic vote.
In Oregon, of course, he clobbered the
field, including Senator Morse, the
hometown boy.
It is said, with some truth, that
Senator Kennedy never had to com
pete against a serious competitor in
the primaries. But that was not his
fault. His major rivals, or at least
some of them, could have entered had
they wanted to do so. Their seeming
reluctance to meet the front runner
head-on served to aid the Kennedy
THURSDAY, JULY 14, 1960
r build-up. He looked like a winner, he
• performed like a winner, and if there
is anything that is dear to the hearts
of politicians it is a candidate who, in
their judgment, can win. So the Demo
crats, swallowing whatever misgivings
they may have had, decided last night
to put their chips down on the young
man from Massachusetts.
U. N. to the Rescue
The extraordinary emergency ses
sion of the United Nations Security
Council has resulted in action designed
to save the Congo Republic from com
plete anarchy and dissolution. The
action, taken in response to an urgent
appeal from the distraught government
of the fledgling new nation, has set
in motion a plan devised by Secretary
General Dag Hammarsjkold to restore
military discipline to the country’s mu
tinous army, meet certain critical needs
in the Congolese economy and bring
about general stability.
In connection with all this, the
Kremlin has accused the United States
and other Western powers of having
aided Belgium in “unleashing armed
aggression” against its former colony.
Actually, of course, the “armed aggres
sion” has consisted solely and simply
of measures to protect thousands of
Belgians and other Europeans from the
native troops who have been on a ram
page ever since the advent of independ
ence a fortnight ago. Clearly, the So
viet condemnation of such protective
action can only be described as yet an
other example of the maliciousness and
utter untruthfulness of communism’s
current all-out propaganda drive against
the free world in general and our own
country in particular.
Nevertheless, when the time came
to vote in the 11-Nation Security Coun
cil early this morning, the Russian dele
gate voted with seven other members
(including the United States) in favor
of the Tunisian resolution backing the
Hammarsjkold plan. As a result (France,
Britain and Nationalist China abstained
on the ground that the resolution im
plicitly censures the Belgians for ag
gression), the following program is to
be put into operation with all possible
speed: (1) The immediate dispatch of
a small group of military officers, wear
ing U. N. uniforms, to help the Con
golese government build up a disciplined
army. (2) Emergency shipment of food
to head off threatened acute shortages.
And (3) the stationing in the country
of a special United Nations force, which
would be made up chiefly of contingents
from African states and which would
be much the same as the force on duty
in the Gaza Strip along the Israeli-
Egyptian border.
At the same time, in approving
action along this line, the Council has
requested Belgium to withdraw its forces
from the Congo Republic, but no time
limit has been fixed as to that. Pre
sumably the withdrawal will take place
when, as and if Mr. Hammarsjkold’s
rescue mission succeeds in helping the
Kasavubu-Lumumba government to re
store order. The “if” here is very big,
however, and one must keep one’s
fingers crossed even while hoping for
the best.
'Symbol of Democracy'
In contrast to the excessive and
often meaningless rhetoric of parts of
the Democratic platform, the three
paragraph section on the District of
Columbia is a model of succinctness. No
more fitting occasion than a presidential
nominating convention could be found
to express support for the constitutional
amendment granting Washingtonians
the right to vote for President and Vice
President. This support had a special
timeliness, furthermore, since 47 State
legislatures—the majority of them con
trolled by Democrats—are scheduled to
meet next year, and the Los Angeles
delegates can perform no greater service
to the District than to carry the ratifi
cation plea back to their homes.
We also commend the language of
the platform which recommends con
gressional passage of a second constitu
tional amendment to grant District resi
dents representation in Congress. In
addition, the convention reaffirmed the
traditional party position in favor of
some form of home rule legislation. The
Immediate need, however, and the one
toward which Washington should mo
bilize its major effort In 1961, is ratifica
tion of the 23d Amendment. That action
would be a notable advance toward
the goal of the convention—the Na
tion’s Capital should be a “symbol of
democracy to people throughout the
world.”
Mexico and Cuba
Two leading members of Mexico’s
Congress have spoken out in a manner
suggesting that the government of
President Adolfo Lopez Mateos can be
counted upon by Fidel Castro to side
with Cuba in its worsening dispute with
the United States. But the uneasiness
created in Washington by this state
ment—a statement implying strong
support for the Havana regime, right
or wrong—seems to have been unwar
ranted. At any rate, official assurances
to that effect have just beeen offered by
Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello.
Thus, in a formal clarifying state
ment designed to eliminate unfounded
misgivings, Mr. Tello has declared that
although President Lopez Mateos natur
ally hopes for an amicable settlement
of the trouble between our country and
Cuba, the two legislators have spoken
only for themselves, not for the govern
ment. In short, members of Mexico’s
Congress are like members of our own
Congress in that their words do not
necessarily reflect the policy of the
executive branch. It is reassuring to
have this stated officially by the Foreign
Minister.

'l'm Ready for Him . . . Soon as I Get Past Rocky'
LETTERS TO THE STAR
Cuban Situation
On the principle that he
who hesitates is lost, a
prompt landing in Cuba,
with, or without OAS sup
port is the safest answer to
Khrushchev’s history-mak
ing insolence in threatening
the United States with rock
ets “if the Pentagon dares to
start an intervention.”
Such blustering at a time
when Russia is utterly in
capable of winning a nuclear
war gives an arresting pre
view of what to expect when
the Russians catch up with
us as they are rapidly doing.
Banking heavily on Demo
cratic and Republican fear
of the “war party” tag, the
quite sane little peasant who
poses as an impulsive mad
man has thrown down a
challenge which could end
disastrously for us if we ig
nored it or met it with gen
tlemanly “warnings.” He
takes the risk—and has un
doubtedly weighed it care
fully—of losing his enor
mous prestige in the world
and his power and very life
in Russia if the challenge is
taken up sharply as it would
be by an Andrew Jackson or
a Theodore Roosevelt.
Edward CafTery.
« * * 4*
The Cuban situation has
been allowed to get out-of
hand in our State Depart
ment’s backward-bending to
rally South and Central
American countries to our
support. A voice from Mexico
shows the long tendered view
of the average non-United
States American: That the
United States citizens have
taken many profits from
their countries in the past
and present, and now, turn
about is “fair-play.” Any
United States citizen who
has traveled extensively will
agree that the majority of
people believe we have money
and property to burn, and
should it be confiscated . . .
too bad! Consequently, the
rest of the Americas will not
support us as we would like.
We are on our own! Castro is
committed, and must de
pend on slow Russian aid,
unless United States busi
nessmen supply him with his
direly needed food and thus
ruin our chances of showing
the Cuban people the Castro
revolution and his ideals are
not the solution, and that the
Communist-dealing Cuban
leader will end in failure,
being replaced bj* other Com
munists more acceptable to
Mr. K. Is the United States
to meekly throw away its
guarantee for the protection
of the rights and property of
its citizens? Our prestige is
a deficit. Will our State De
partment become a lame
duck this election year while
Castro ridicules us? Herter
has already indicated he in
tends to resign: why does he
even mention this? After Mr.
K’s visit to Cuba agreements
will be made for the estab
lishment of missile bases in
Cuba and then action will be
too late. Confiscation of our
property in Cuba is legal and
moral reason enough to phys
ically intervene and regain
a small degree of our lost
prestige.
James Payne.

The Government is said to
be facing a problem in al
locating the 700.000 tons of
sugar trade we are taking
away from Cuba. If that is
a problem, it is an odd one.
Our farmers are produc
ing surpluses of wheat, corn
and cotton that are costing
over a million dollars a day
just to store. Practically any
land that will grow these
staples will grow sugar beets.
Sugar made from beets can
not be told from cane sugar.
Because we are paying a
premium above the world
price, our sugar purchases
from Cuba represent a sub
sidy to that Government re
ported to be $l5O million a
year. At the rate of $lOO an
acre that sum would subsi
dize a million and a half
acres. Sugar beets yield up to
two tons of sugar an acre,
which gives a total of 3 mil
lion tons. With what could
be saved by a reduction in
the wheat, corn and cotton
surpluses, far more addition-

al acreage could be subsi
dized than is needed to pro
duce all the sugar we use.

I could not agree more with
the sentiment expressed in
the letter “Too Much De
featism” by Ada M. Wentz.
If our press and our poli
ticians would just concen
trate on being good Ameri
cans and stop applauding
Khrushchev when he ""struts
across the stage exuding
superiority” maybe we would
accomplish something.
A man of Khrushchev’s
caliber should be completely
ignored by the press and the
politicians to put him in his
place. Treat his threats with
silent disdain. They are only
so much hogwash.
As long as we feed his ego
with apparent concern, he
will continue to perform for
his audience.
Alice Olenin.
Upward Trend
Congress and the labor
lords, instead of fighting in
flation, are aiding and abet
ting it, by increasing wages.
The Federal pay raise won’t
help the employes, it will only
tend to further the high cost
of living. In the end it is al
ways the merchants in all
fields who profit. When wages
go up for a few, the cost of
living goes up for all. It is
an endless cycle.
Our vote-seeking Congress
could best have helped all
citizens by leaving Federal
salaries where they were and
done something to lower taxes
and the inflationary living
cost but the labor lords and
the merchants wanted the
wage increase. Os course, this
is election year and to insure
coming back to Washington
for another term means more
to Congress than all the peo
ple’s welfare.

For Better Passports
The praise given to Fiances
Knight in The Star Magazine
“Sunday” is well deserved.
The improvements in the
passport issuance routine and
the widening of the basis of
acceptable citizenship proof
are commendable.
I have a few suggestions for
Miss Knight, but they may
not fall under her jurisdic
tion. Please increase the
number of visa pages, for ex
ample. for modern transpor
tation in Europe permits the
crossing of many borders
many times. Perhaps the visa
pages could be measured ac
cording to the length of the
contemplated stay. Age could
be eliminated, for this entry
does not aid in identification
—certainly not with a well
groomed, well dieted Amer
ican woman. Why embarrass
them? Perhaps ten-year age
blocks could be checked or a
thumb-print substituted.
Passports, once not required
by the United States, should
now be issued to any well
known citizen on application
with evidence of long contin
ous residence—say 25 years.
This would include clergy,
newspaper editors to be sure,
teaching profession, civil
service employes, and perhaps
others. Perhaps an oath of
allegiance could be combined
with this and administered at
the time the passport was
issued. I did not include
military personnel in the list
because I believe that it is
traditional with most coun
tries to accept evidence of
long military service, espe
cially concerning wartime, as
adequate, even for citizen
ship.
Actually, passports might
be eliminated with profit if
travel were confined to our
NATO allies, for this would
be an evidence of real unity.

White Elephants
There are white elephants
and there are white ele
phants. Dr. Frederick Brown
Harris, in his “White Ele
phant” article in The Sunday
Star was undoubtedly correct
regarding the “herds"" of
white elephants in American
attics. But I believe he some
what exaggerated the abund
ance of the albino animals
trumpeting through the
Siamese jungles in the days
of the good King Mongkut.
The elephants mentioned
by King Bhumibol in his con
gressional debut June 29, like
the war elephants offered by
his ancestor to Lincoln during
the Civil War. could not have
been white.
For since time immemorial
the precious pachyderms have
been as scarce as elephants at
a Democratic convention. The
Buddhist king who acquired
a white elephant was one step
closer to becoming a Buddha
himself. The fortunate fellow
who actually stumbled across
the animal in the jungle was
showered with honor and
wealth for the rest of his life.
Burmese women vied for the
privilege of feeding a baby
Lord White Elephant milk
from their own breasts. Kings
waged wars over ownership of
the heavyweight godheads.
Even today it would prob
ably be easier to persuade the
Thai King to give up his sax
ophone than the pale little
pachyderm in the Bangkok
Zoo.

Good, Clean Fun
A sincere welcome to ""My
Fair Lady,” a production
which provides wholesome
and beautiful entertainment!
The audience was not dragged
through the “gutters” of life.
The applause was genuine
and great, the audience
emerged from the theater
with happy, radiant faces and
laughter in their voices.
There were no palliative ex
pressions, such as, “But it
was well done, even though I
feel the need of a cleansing
bath.”
All this disproves the ap
parent sentiments of pro
ducers, playwrights, novelists
and publishers that the pub
lic must be given what it de
mands, “mature” and “adult”
entertainment, meaning, of
course, that it must be
“dirtied up.”
Mary Ellen Dashiell.
Evils of Drink
The July 3 issue of The
Sunday Star carried an arti
cle entitled, “Liquor Prob
lems Cited as Cause in Crime.”
It stated that the stupid
policy of punishing a man for
punishment's sake is like
blaming the true alcoholic
for getting drunk. Then the
policy of the AA is mentioned
relative to the alcoholic. This
article, like many others,
completely distorts the true
nature of alcoholism.
The alcoholic, of course,
should be given help, kind
ness and every aid available
to free him from the horrible
addiction he has chosen to
bring upon himself. But he
should not be told alcoholism
is a sickness for that is a
calculated untruth; it doesn't
help him; but, instead pro
vides him with an excuse for
his indifference.
The mere fact that AA of
fers assistance only to those
who make the decision to ab
stain from alcohol, outright
places alcoholism in the cate
gory of sin and not disease.
Can you imagine a hospital
or any particular medical
agency refusing to accept a
patient suffering from pneu
monia or even blood-poison
ing for the sole reason that
the patient himself wasn't
concerned about his condi
tion or because he didn’t
care if he got well.
Nowhere in the Bible is any
person condemned for being
sick, but in 1 Corinthians
6:10 it says: “Nor thieves,
nor covetous, nor drunkards,
—shall inherit the kingdom
of God.” This definitely
places the alcoholic in the
category of the sinful and not
the sick.
John E. Macmillan.
THE POLITICAL MILL
By GOULD LINCOLN
Stevenson Drive Came Too Late
LOS ANGELES. —The ef
fort to breathe life into the
presidential candidacy of
Adlai Stevenson was both a
dramatic and pathetic inci
dent at the Democratic Na
tional Convention last night.
Although made by several
of the party’s foremost fig
ures of the Roosevelt New
Deal era, it failed gloomily
indeed.
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt,
widow of President Franklin
D. Roosevelt, was given the
special privilege of making
her appeal for Mr. Steven
son. The time for seconders
of the Stevenson nomination
had expired when Mrs.
Roosevelt was escorted to the
platform. She made an ap
peal for her favorite candi
date, and couched thd ap
peal in glowing terms. She
said Mr. Stevenson was the
best qualified man—the man
the Nation needs in these
days of stress and strain.
Former Senator Herbert
Lehman of New York, once
Governor of that State, was
as emphatic as Mrs. Roose
velt in his praise for Mr.
Stevenson and in his warn
ing that a man of wide
knowledge of international
affairs should be nominated
and elected President. Lt.
Gov. Glenn Anderson of
California and Lt. Gov. Wil
son Wyatt of Kentucky also
seconded the nomination of
Mr. Stevenson. It was Sena
tor Eugene McCarthy of
Minnesota who placed the
Stevenson name before the
convention.
The appeals of this galaxy
of Democratic stars had no
effect on the delegates—
although their pleas were
accompanied by the loudest
and most enthusiastic dem
onstration seen in the con
vention hall.
Agrees to “Draft”
It should be said, of course,
that Mr. Stevenson never be
came an announced candi
date, although he finally said
that he would not run away
from a “draft,” and agreed
to permit his friends to place
his name in nomination at
the convention.
Indeed, Mr. Stevenson made
no campaign at all. But the
hard core of the old Steven
son following-- of 1952 and
1956 did their best to stir
interest throughout the coun
try. Mr. Stevenson, then
Governor of Illinois, actually
was drafted in 1952. At that
time he was a candidate for
re-election as Governor and
THIS AND THAT
By CHARLES E. TRACEWELL
Our alley is much more
interesting than our street.
It has a personal air the
street lacks. The latter is
spick and span, perfectly
proper, neat and trim, but it
lacks personality.
Our alley oozes person
ality.
It bristles defiance at the
passing world, showing once
and for all something of the
people that live there. It is
not impersonal, like the
street.
•* * *
As a matter of fact, the
alley is paved and the street
is not, so the former already
Mr. Tracewell is ill and in his ab
sence The Sior is reprinting some
of his columns of other years. He
requests that no telephone or
other messages be sent to his
home during his illness. From The
Star of July 8, 1924.
has the “edge” on the latter
in the mere matter of
physique.
But the paving is the least
of its merits. Asphalt makes
it easier for the ash man,
the trash man and the gar
bage man, worthy minions
of the municipal govern
ment. Sometimes when they
throw the cans down too
hard, one is tempted to feel
they are not so worthy, after
all, but dares not say what he
thinks.
""Say a word.” the trash
man seems to threaten; “just
say one word, and I’ll smash
your darn old can to pieces
on the next trip!”
So nobody says anything in
our alley.
** * *
Our alley is twenty feet
wide, sloped so to the west
that the rains run in a veri
table torrent down the neat
“V” which is its center.
Bordering it are the back
fences, the low kind that is
replacing the famous old
high back fences, long the
subject of comment, song and
drama. If the high fence is a
thing of the past, maybe it
is too bad, maybe it is good.
All depends on your mem
ories.
If you ask the cats, how
ever. there will be a unani
mous vote in favor of the old
board fences. A respectable
tomcat that has never
prowled along a high board
fence has missed something
in life, I have it on high au
thority from my feline
friends.
So much for the physical
aspects of the alley. They are
but the letter. The spirit lies
in the men and the women,
their children, their dogs and
cats, their flowers and vege
tables, all those mysterious
beings who live there, and
make the alley what it is. For
the dogs live there as much
as their masters, and so do
the cats and flowers and even
the vegetables. Each is a liv
ing thing.
44 4 4
So it is the living beings
and things, then, that make
our alley what it is.
This is particularly so in
protested strongly even when
the Democratic National
Convention had met against
a nomination. In the end.
he was persuaded by the
then President Truman to
make the race.
It is a sad note in the
Stevenson political career
that four years later the man
who had persuaded him to
run turned his back, declar
ing that Mr. Stevenson would
be beaten worse in 1956 than
in 1952. But this is politics.
Mr. Truman always resented
the fact that Mr. Stevenson,
after his nomination in
advertently referred to ""the
mess” in Washington—which
was the Truman administra
tion.
During last night’s great,
noisy demonstration for Mr.
Stevenson, the cheers and ap
plause came not from the
delegates seated on the floor
of the convention hall, but
from the demonstrators who
were allowed to stream into
the hall with banners, band
and balloons, and from the
galleries. The delegates sat
quietly, and a sad note was
that in the Illinois delega
tion, with 69 convention
votes, there were only two
votes for the State’s native
son and former Governor.
Leaned Over Backwards
Although charges had been
made that the convention
had been “rigged” for Sen
ator Kennedy by Democratic
National Chairman Paul M.
Butler, it was noticeable that
more time was given the
Stevenson demonstrators and
the speakers for Mr. Steven
son by far than was per
mitted the demonstrators and
the speakers for Senator
Kennedy, Senator Lyndon
Johnson of Texas, the runner
up, or Senator Symington of
Missouri. Indeed, the perma
nent chairman of the con
vention leaned over back
wards to favor the Stevenson
adherents.
It is the old story of a
too-late-and-too-little effort
in politics.
Mr. Stevenson now passes
from the scene as a possible
presidential candidate—prob
ably never to be considered
for such a role again. This
does not mean, however, that
he will not occupy an impor
tant position in the national
Government. His selection to
be Secretary of State by
Senator Kennedy, should
Senator Kennedy win election
next November, has been
widely predicted.
the springtime, even such a
wet spring as we had this
year, so backward, so dreary,
so unappeal’ng to most.
Ask of the sweet peas
climbing on their strings,
give ear, if you can. to the
song of the just blooming
roses, and you will hear
something like this:
""What a wonderful place
of light this is!
""Surely this must be the
spring of w'hich our ances
tors told us.
""Down from the first seed
they have whispered tales of
the light.
""I am a child of darkness,
shut up in a tiny space, but
I have possibilities.
“I was such a speck, so
dark and little, when I was
put down in the ground.
“They did not dream, nor
did I. scarcely, that I would
ever make my way into the
world like this.
“But here I am. and this
is spring. The old seeds sung
it; now I know that what
they said is true.
""They sang of the light and
the sun and the rain and
the green. I see the light.
There is green and there is
rain.
“I will wait for the sun.”
i 44 4 4
In our alley the birds are
noisy every morning.
Some of them chatter so
the cats cannot refrain from
gnashing their teeth at them.
The cats fairly chatter at
them like monkeys.
Two fat robins hit a tele
phone wire with a resound
ing swish. They stick tight,
while the wire vibrates to its
whole length, swaying as if
to shake the birds off.
Atop a telephone pole a
blackbird takes its morning
survey. At exactly 6 o’clock
each mmning the bird takes
its post.
Somewhere a whippoorwill
sings its long-drawm notes. It
is not every neighborhood
that has a whippoorwill.
44 4 4
The spring was a time of
great digging, raking, plant
ing, sprinkling, painting.
The yards were dug up and
planted to grass seed. In a
few short weeks in many
yards there was a green
sward. fresh in the morning
dew.
You will find every treat
ment of yard there. Some
have gone in for simplicity,
while others have spent
much time on more ornate
treatments, such as rock
paths and slate-lined walks.
Each to his fancy. Was it
not Terence, who said, “So
many men, so many opin
ions""? And Horace, worthy
Roman: “All men do not, in
fine, admire or love the same
thing.”
But. “we hardly find any
persons of good sense save
those who agree with us.”
So each family sticks to its
own yard, and no doubt has
other things to say, in pri
vate, than the neighborly
pleasantries passed over back
fences.",w join jhaf sunday morning edition publiihad evening star newspaper company washington samuel kauhmann prtsident benjamin mckelway editor main office ind virginia european bureau paris france

AMERICA'S SPACEPORT
Canaveral Marks First Decade
Next Sunday Cope Canaveral celebratei
iti 10th anniversary as the launching
pad for America's entry into the rocket
age. Looking at spectacular Canaveral
today, it's hard to believe the fimt
missile was fired from the Cope only
10 years ago. Here's the story of
Canaveral's first decade.
By HOWARD BENEDICT
Associated Press Staff Writer
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.—They
called the rocket ""Bumper.” It was
a makeshift vehicle of two stages,
built by marrying a German V-2
and an Army Wac-Corporal.
The launching stand was a
plumber’s nightmare: an 80-foot
spider-web of pipe and scaffold
ing, weighted at the base with
sandbags. Wires, cables and as
sorted gear hung limply from its
sides.
A jeep raced back and fourth
on a sandy road leading to the
launching site to frighten away
poisonous snakes.
After five days of frustrating
labor, and one misfire, Bumper
blasted off in a swirl of fire and
thunder at 9:29 a.m. July 24, 1950
—just 10 years ago. The rocket
performed perfectly and dropped
into the Atlantic 50 miles offshore.
That was the first missile shot
from Cape Canaveral, proving
ground for America’s military
missiles and her biggest port of*
departure for space.
The changes at Cape Canaveral
In 10 years have been startling.
Before that first missile crew
moved in, the cape was a desolate
arrowhead of land jutting into the
ocean. It was a wasteland of
scrub brush, inhabited by alliga
tors. snakes and insects.
Time has transformed these 15,-
000 acres into a spectacular com
plex of soaring gantry towers,
concrete blockhouses, hangers,
roads and electronic marvels.
Scrub brush still covers much
if the land, out beneath it spreads
a finely woven network of cables
and wires to carry impulses of en
ergy, vital messages and electronic
signals that send a missle roaring
into the sky.
Here, thousands of scientists,
engineers and technicians work
with mammoth missiles of awe
some power and possibility.
Almost to Africa
Canaveral is their workshop but
their testing ground stretches
more than 5,000 miles down the
Atlantic along a chain of 12 island
stations extending almost to the
coast of Africa. From these is
lands, most of them foreign owned.
United States tracking facilities
record missile flights. A dozen
tracking ships All big gaps be
tween islands.
Eighteen miles south of the
Cape is Patrick Air Force Base,
administrative and technical sup
port headquarters for the Air
Force Missile Test Center—which
calls signals in the workshop and
downrange.
Test center facilities represent
a total capital investment of $650
million. Operating costs for fiscal
1959 exceeded $l3O million.
Maj. Gen. Donald N. Yates com
manded the Missile Test Center
from 1954 to May, 1960, during its
years of greatest expansion. Look
ing back before turning over his
command to Maj. Gen. Leighton
I. Davis, Gen. Yates said:
“The progress of the military
missile program has exceeded all

eluded unless and until the revo
lutionary regime changes its ways
towards the United States.
In his complaint to the Security
Council, Foreign Minister Roa
said the United States has har
bored Cuban war criminals, per
mitted planes flying out of air
ports in this country to violate
Cuban air space and attempted to
strangle the Cuban economy by
refusing to refine crude oil shipped
in from Russia.
The latter reference was to a
decision of American-owned com
panies against refining oil ob
tained in a recent agreement with
the Soviets. Mr. Roa also men
tioned Cuba’s sugar problem,
which was aggravated week before
last when President Eisenhower
barred virtually any further im
ports of Cuban sugar this year.
The order will cost Cuba the sale
of approximately 1 million tons of
sugar in the United States before
January 1.
But the Castro government
turned hopefully to Communist
countries for customers. At the
end of the week a 14-member
delegation from Red China was in
Havana to negotiate the purchase
of 500,000 tons of sugar and Rus
sia reportedly was interested in
buying more than already agreed
upon.
Air Treaty:
Postponed
Officials in Washington indefi
nitely postponed conversations
with Soviet Russia on a civil
airlines agreement.
When the United States, on
Thursday, called off negotiations
on an air transport agreement
with Russia, Washington under
scored its toughening attitude to
ward the Kremlin.
The State Department already
had rejected Premier Khru
shchev’s protectionist attitude to
ward Cuba. Now it made clear
that it considered relations with
Russia had deteriorated so badly
that the prevailing atmosphere
would have an adverse effect upon
any discussions held.
The decision to defer talks on a
Moscow-to-New York air agree
ment followed a series of bristling
charges by Mr. Khrushchev
against the United States. It em
phasized the widening gap be
tween the world’s two leading
powers since the summit collapse
in Paris.

AN ATLAS with a spaceman nose capsule stands on a launching
pad at Cape Canaveral ready for takeoff.
expectations. In most cases, the
development programs have been
phenomenal. The Atlas, Thor and
Jupiter all have developed into re
liable operational weapons. The
Polaris and Titan are coming
along nicely, and soon we’ll begin
testing more advanced weapons
like the Minuteman.
“Much of our thinking and
planning now is geared to space.
Someday man may start for the
moon and other planets from
here. The prospects appear un
limited.”
Two of the best-known and
most capable missilemen here are
Bill Stitt and B. G. (Mac) Mac-
Nabb, project directors for the
Douglas Thor and Convair Atlas
programs respectively. Both have
been with the programs since they
began and have seen these mis
siles develop into two of the
United States' most reliable roc
kets and as boosters for the ma
jority of this Nation's space and
satellite shots.
Mr. Stitt recalls the hectic early
days of the Thor development.
“We name here in 1956 on a
crash pogram,” he said. “That
meant getting the missile program
ready and operational yesterday,
not tomorrow.
""The pace of the program was
tremendous. Although I was an
operations engineer, I sometimes
found myself manipulating
wrenches with the mechanics, co
ordinating activities prior to
launch or manning a console in
the blockhouse during countdown.
""The crew took the early Thor
failures hard, but their morale
and enthusiasm remained high.
THE FOREIGN SCENE
Th* cancellation of the airline
negotiations also raised questions
affecting talks between the United
States, Britain and Russia on a
treaty to bar nuclear weapons
tests. But the State Department
insisted Washington has no inten
tion of breaking off these negoti
ations.
While the breach between East
and West widened, the Western
allies made new gestures for unity
among themselves. Washington,
for example, moved to assure
Britain of its willingness to mod
ify arrangements for use of air
bases in Britain.
The question of modification
came up in the House of Com
mons last week when Prime Min
ister Macmillan discussed the
shooting down of an American
RB-47 by Russia on July 1. Rus
sia claims the plane, which oper
ated from a British base, was fly
ing over Soviet territory. Wash
ington, denying this, insisted the
craft was “wantonly attacked”
while in flight over international
waters.
Russia filed a complaint in the
U. N. Security Council. The J
United States welcomed this ac
tion, saying it could prove its con
tention.
Obviously the Soviets had seized
upon one more incident in a re
* lentless campaign to discredit
United States leadership and pres
tige, attack the system of mili
tary bases abroad and do what
they can to smash such anti-Com
munist alliances as the North At
lantic Treaty Organization.
The Congo:
Major Crisis
The United Nations Security
Council authorized the dispatch
of U. N. military forces to Congo,
the new African nation beset by
violence and threatened by an
archy.
The United Nations Security
Council remained in session past
midnight Wednesday to debate, and
finally approve an urgent request
by Secretary General Dag Ham
marskjold for authority to send
U. N. troops into Congo for the
purpose of bringing order out of
chaos.
In little more than 24 hours,
the first troops had arrived—a
contingent of 380 men from
Ghana and Tunisia flown into
Leopoldville by the United States
Air Force.
This was the start of a U. N.
effort to end the violence which
THE SUNDAY STAR
Washin/Un, D, C., July 17, 1960
When missile No. 105 (the fifth
fired) finally broke our losing
streak in September, 1957, we
were on our way and operational
in just two years.
“Looking back, it's hard to be
lieve that technology has ad
vanced to its present state in so
few years.”
Learned by Failures
The Atlas program also got off
to a bumpy start, ""but each bad
shot taught us something and en
abled us to develop the missile
we have today,” explains Mr. Mc-
Nabb.
“Personally,” Mr. MacNabb said,
“I got the biggest kick when we
put No. 108 into orbit in De
cember. 1958.” This is the satel
lite that relayed President Eisen
hower's Christmas peace message
to the world.
Mr. MacNabb cited the recent
success of the Atlas over a 9.000-
mile course and the Atlas-boosted
Midas satellite as major achieve
ments of the program.
There also have been disappoint
ments. such as the failure of two
Atlas-Able moon rockets last fall.
“We’ll get a couple more cracks
at the moon this year,” Mr. Mac-
Nabb added. “We’re confident
we’ll make it.”
Atlas. Thor, Jupiter, Redstone,
Snark and Matador all grew to

Mr. Hammarskjold took pains
to ask that the great world powers
be excluded from sending troops,
to replace Belgian forces that
stirred up native resentment. In
stead of men, the United States
and Russia, Britain, Italy and In
dia were asked tp provide food and
transportation and the African
states received preference for
troops.
Arrival of the U. N. forces
seemed to create a more relaxed
atmosphere in the tense commu
nities victimized by rioting, beat
ings, murders and rape when
Congolese soldiers mutinied
against their white Belgian offi
cers.
But in Moscow, Soviet Premier
Khrushchev was making ominous
sounds about the Congo as well
as about Cuba, the United States
and the West in general. Declar
ing the United Nations action may
not have been adequate, he said
Russia would intercede on its own
“if those states which are carry
ing on direct aggression against
the Congo do not stop their crim
inal measures.” Earlier he had
accused Western countries, includ
ing the United States, of attempt- 1
ing to reimpose colonial rule on
the new African nation as soon as 1
it became independent. 1
“The demand of the Soviet 1
Union is simple—hands off the
Republic of Congo,” warned Mr. ’
Khrushchev. Thus he continued
to assert Russian rights to dictate
policy around the world. 1
Premier Khrushchev made his
pronouncement in answer to an I
appeal from Congo’s President
Joseph Kasavubu and Premier
Patrice Lumumba for Soviet in
tervention if the Western nations
do not ""desist from aggression.” |
For Japan:
New Premier
I
Hayate Ikeda, Japanese Minister
of Trade, was chosen head of the
country's ruling political ■ party and is
due to be elected the new Prime Min- ’
ister of Japan.
Uneasiness prevailed in Tokyo
last week as Japan began a new
phase of its test in popular democ
racy. The time had come for Pre
mier Nobusuke Kishi to make
good on a pledge to step down, a
ill-fated Vanguard in 1957, space
shots have become more and more
frequent. After the Army lofted
America’s first satellite into orbit
on January 31, 1958, there have
been almost monthly attempts to
launch satellites from the Cape.
More than a dozen have succeeded.
Others have been placed in orbit
from Vandenberg Air Force Base,
Calif.
Many of these intrusions in
space have gathered data for the
program dominating Cape think
ing today Project Mercury,
America's effort to put a man in
orbit and return him safely to
earth.
Before the end of this year, one
or more of the seven Mercury
astronauts expects to climb into
a space capsule and be launched
by a Redstone on a sub-orbital
flight that could carry him as
high as 100 miles and 200 miles
down range. If all goes right, the
first orbital flight will be made
in 1961 in an cap
sule. Success could pave the way
for interplanetary travel.
Project Mercury reflects a shift
in the United States space pro
gram from that of a purely scien
tific study toward finding out
more of what space can do for
man and what man can do in
space.
Present Cape planning calls for
construction of 11 launching com
plexes to handle rockets with en
gine thrusts ranging from 1 to 10
million pounds. The biggest cur
rent booster, the Atlas, generates
360,000 pounds.
New Launch Areas
Two new launch areas, desig
nated Very Heavy and Ultra
Heavy, have been set aside.
Work is well underway in this
the Very Heavy area on a com
plex for the million-and-a-half
pound thrust Saturn rocket. The
Saturn, more than 200 feet tall,
is being groomed to carry manned
and multi-ton payloads. First
flight tests are set for next year,
but it probably will be 1964 before
useful flights are made.
One of the ultra-heavy pads
will be used for Nova, a 6-million
pound thrust vehicle scheduled for
unmanned round trips to the
moon and Venus within five years.
While plotting the march into
space, the test center has not
overlooked its main mission, the
testing of military rockets.
An official commented:
“Eventually, space activity will
overtake the military missile pro
gram here. But right now it’s our
military rockets which will deter
an enemy from striking, or enable
us to hit back if he does. They
make possible future peaceful ex
peditions into space.”
The growth of the test center
and the surrounding area has been
as remarkable as the missiles that
fly here.
In 1950, the working population
of the center was about 850. The
latest count shows 20,100, more
than 16,000 civilian. A total of 30
civilian contractors have opera
tions here. Four years ago there
were 11.
The impact has been spectacular
on Brevard County, where the
center is located. As missiles re
placed citrus as the majoi indus
try. the population has increased
from 23,653 in 1950 to an esti
mated 110,000 today. The Air
Force expects it to reach 150,000
by 1964.

mier is scheduled tomorrow. Just
an hour after the choice was
announced a right-wing fanatic
rushed up to Mr. Kishi at his offi
cial residence and stabbed him in
the thigh six times with a hunt
ing knife. Bleeding profusely, he
was taken to a hospital, where
doctors held hope for an early
recovery.
Extra Protection
But police ordered extra pro
tection for all top government
leaders, left-wing members of
parliament as well as conser
vatives. Reports circulated that
several officials had been selected
as prime targets of the ultra
nationalists.
Meanwhile, Mr. Ikeda, the for
mer Minister of Trade and In
dustry, proceeded with plans to
restore order, rebuild Japanese
prestige abroad after the damage
resulting from the cancellation of
President Eisenhower’s trip and
revive public confidence in the
parliamentary process.
The new premier is regarded as
an able administrator, a todgh
and resourceful politician. He is
a foe of Communism and a friend
of the United States.
Three Ex-Presidents Will
Revive an Old Question
By ROBERT E. CLARK
Star Staff Writer
Ex-Presidents, H. L. Mencken
once suggested, should be made
Methodist bishops on their de
parture from the White House.
“As they complete their terms
their consciences are clear, and
their chances of going to heaven
are excellent.” the Baltimore
iconoclast reasoned. “But a few
years of longing and repining are
enough to imperil the souls of
even the most philosophical of
them.”
Whatever the merits of Mr.
Mencken’s proposal to initiate re
tiring Presidents into the clergy
it was a cut kinder than his al
ternative suggestion that they be
turned over to the hangman,
along with all the defeated candi
dates for the White House.
There is no clear record of
how many former Presidents
pined to return to office, except
for those who confided their
wishes to the electorate and
sought to renew their destiny
through the polls. There are
ample case histories, however, of
those as Grant, Monroe and
Theodore Roosevelt—who found it
difficult to adjust to the peculiar
limbo into which America cast
its ex-Presidents after it stripped
them of perquisites and portfolio.
Harry Truman’s current pique
over his party’s choice of Senator
Kennedy as its candidate for the
office he once held and his im
potence to do anything about it—
or about the nomination of Adlai
Stevenson over his objections in
1956—might provide another case
in point, though Mr. Truman ap
pears to have settled happily into
the role of private citizen in other
regards.
All of which is preface to a sta
tistical note of some significance.
When President Eisenhower joins
Mr. Truman and Herbert Hoover
in retirement in January, the
United States will have three liv
ing ex-Presidents for the first
time since the death of Gen.
Grant in 1885.
Mr. Eisenhower’s situation is
unique in national history in that
he will be the first President
ever barred—by the two-term
limitation of the Twenty-Second
Amendment—from returning to
office.
Proposals Lag
There are some who feel that
all former Presidents should be
made members of the Senate, but
the proposal has gained little
headway in recent years. Another
current suggestion for making use
of the talents of ex-Presidents is
to have them serve on a special
advisory council for national se
curity.
While unusual in recent na
tional history, a surfeit of erst
while Presidents was common in
the Nation’s earlier years. There
were five living ex-Presidents at
the start of the Civil War—Van
SCIENCE PIONEER
London's Royal Society
By WILLIAM HINES
Star Science Writer
The recent International Geo
physical Year was acclaimed as a
civilized period in history when
contending nations managed to
co-operate wholeheartedly in the
interests of science. But IGY
type co-operation was achieved
nearly two centuries ago when
British scientific ships sailed the
Atlantic during the Revolution
anry War, free from molestation
by the American Navy.
The agency that made this
early scientific amity possible was
the Royal Society, Britain's august
congress of intellectuals which
marks its 300th anniversary this
week. The Royal Society engaged
the good offices of one of its fel
lows in the rebelling colonies, Dr.
Benjamin Franklih of Philadel
phia, who arranged to have hands
kept off the scientific expedition
of Capt. James Cook and Joseph
Banks, botanist.
The “Royal Society of London
for the Promotion of Natural
Knowledge” was the ax that
severed the modern world’s last
link with the error-ridden past
of Aristotle and Ptolemy. Formed
in secret during England’s Crom
wellian civil war, a precursor
group coalesced around the skep
tical writings of Francis Bacon,
Lord Verulam, and eventually
grew into the Royal Society.
Bacon's Views Were Basic
Bacon was that wonderfully
brilliant, wonderfully corrupt
Elizabethan jurist who is remem-

Buren, Tyler, Fillmore, Pierce and
Buchanan.
Unlike several of his predeces
sors, Mr. Eisenhower will face no
financial worries as he leaves of
fice. Under the 1958 presidential
pension act, he will receive $25,000
a year for the rest of his life.
The law provides an additional
$50,000 a year for office expense
and a clerical staff.
Mr. Eisenhower’s total worth,
including stock holdings and the
value of his Gettysburg farm, has
been estimated at close to $1 mil
lion. “Crusade in Europe,” his
best-selling account of World War
11, earned him some $476,000,
after taxes.
The President has confided to
Intimates that he plans to resume
a part-time writing career on
leaving the White House. He re
gards writing as the most logical
employment open to him, since it
will permit him to present his
views on important national is
sues in away which will add to
his income without demeaning
the presidency. His first project
is expected to be his White House
memoirs.
As an author Mr. Eisenhower
may find himself in competition
with Mr. Truman, who has al
ready completed three volumes
dealing with his own years in the
Executive Mansion. Mr. Hoover
has also authored books since
leaving the White House but has
made his most lasting mark as an
expert on reorganization of the
executive branch.
Gen. Grant, like Mr. Eisenhow
er a military hero when he won
the presidency, wrote his memoirs
in desparation to pay off his debts
after a brokerage firm he had
founded on leaving office went
bankrupt. Completed shortly be
fore his death, they brought his
family $450,000.
Oldest in History
By the end of his term Mr.
Eisenhower, who will be 70 Octo
ber 14, will be the oldest President
in the Nation’s history. Andrew
Jackson’s second term ended 11
days short of his 70th birthday.
Buchanan’s single term ended a
month before he was 70.
Mr. Hoover, 86, Mr. Truman,
76, and Mr. Eisenhower are all
contenders for the longevity rec
ord set by John Adams, who lived
to be 90 and died July 4, 1826,
the same day as Thomas Jeffer
son, his successor in the presi
dency.
Buchanan, who left the White
House just 100 years ago, was, like
Mr. Eisenhower, a gentleman
farmer who retired to his Penn
sylvania acreage.
Mr. Eisenhower’s permanent
address will be Gettysburg when
he leaves office, though he has
indicated some interest in buying
a cottage in Palm Springs, Calif.,
one of his favorite golf-and-sun
retreats. He will have a chance
at Gettysburg to Indulge his en-
bered for his defense, when
charged with bribery, that he
could not have been unduly influ
enced because he accepted gifts
from both sides. A less famous
but more constructive observation
by Bacon was that all existing
doctrines on natural phenomena
should be doubted until confirmed
by verified observation. This is the
heart of the modern scientific
method, which goes to nature
rather than to the old writings
for its answers.
After the end of tne Cromwell
dictatorship and the restoration of
Charles 11, the society came into
the open, and soon was granted
the King's patronage and the
right to call Itself “Royal Society.”
From its start, the Society en
couraged gadgeteering by its mem
bers. In fact, the stated purpose
of the Society was ""to improve
the knowledge of natural things,
and all useful Arts. Manufactures,
Mechanick Practices, Engines and
Inventions by experiments (not
meddling with Divinity, Meta
physics, Moralls, Politicks. Gram
mar, Rhetoric or Logick).”
Attacked as Eggheads
In spite of this, the Society soon
came to be regarded as a cabal of
eggheads by some, and as posses
sors of godless knowledge by
others. Attacks on the Royal So
ciety had no effect on its contin
ued well-being, however.
The ""natural philosophers” of
the Royal Society elected Sir Isaac
Newton their president in 1703,
and named Dr. Franklin a Fellow
thusiasm for Aberdeen Angus
cattle.
There is broad precedent in the
post-White House careers of other
Presidents for full and part-time
jobs which might strike Mr.
Eisenhower’s fancy.
John Quincy Adams served nine
terms in the House of Representa
tives. Andrew Johnson, tried by
the Senate after he was impeached
by the House, provided one of the
more dramatic moments in that
body’s history when, he returned
briefly as a Senator from Tennes
see a few months before his death.
John Tyler, onst of the quintet
of ex-Presidents surviving when
the South fired on Fort Sumter,
got elected to Congress, too—he
served in the Confederate Pro
visional Congress and was elected
to the House of Representatives
of the Confederate Congress, but
died before taking office.
Other Careers
Theodore Roosevelt pursued big
game in Africa for a time before
his unsuccessful effort to regain
the presidency on the Bull Moose
ticket. He later led an expedition
into the Brazilian jungles. Wil
liam Howard Taft became Chief
Justice. Thomas Jefferson retired
to Monticello and lent his diverse
talents to founding the University
of Virginia.
When his term of office ex
pired, President Monroe the fifth
Chief Executive, returned to Vir
ginia and for a while to private
life.
He was among the former
Presidents who experienced seri
ous flnancal difficulties and in
1826 Congress appropriated $30,-
000 for him in settlement of some
claims he had filed against the
Government.
Mr. Monroe became a member
of the Board of Visitors of the
University of Virginia and in
1829 was elected to the Virginia
Constitutional Convention. He
served as its chairman.
After the death of his wife,
still Involved in financial diffi
culties, he moved to New York
City to live with his daughter
and her husband. It was there
that he died.
Washington wrote that he was
content at Mount Vernon, ""to
make and sell, a little flour ... to
amuse myself in agriculture and
rural pursuits . . .”
The first President may have
set a precedent for Mr. Eisenhow
er, however, when he accepted ap
pointment as Lieutenant General
and Commander-in-Chief of the
Army after his retirement to
Mount Vernon.
Mr. Eisenhower has hinted to
friends that he would like to end
his career in the five-star rank
he gave up when he became Presi
dent. It would take a special act
of Congress to make him a Gen
eral of the Army again, but there
is little doubt that Congress will
readily give back his stars if he
wants them.
in 1756. Franklin would be in
eligible for Fellowship in the Royal
Society if he were alive today,
because Fellows must be subjects
of the British crown. However, he
undoubtedly would be a ""foreign
member""—not entitled to append
the coveted initials F. R. S. to his
name, but accepted by the Fel
lows as an equal.
One-third of the 63 foreign
members of the Royal Society to
day are Americans. Among them
are Drs. Linus Pauling and Harold
Urey, Nobel prize winners, and
James Bryant Conant, chemist,
former president of Harvard and
government scientific adviser. All
three are members of the Society's
American counterpart, the Na
tional Academy of Sciences.
This “hands-across-the-sea” ar
rangement works the other way,
too. Foreigners are not eligible to
become Members of the NAS, but
may be named Foreign Associates.
Among the Fellows of the Royal
Society who are also Foreign As
sociates of NAS are Mathemati
cian Paul Dirac, Physiologist
Baron Adrian of Cambridge, and
Physicist Sir William Bragg.
The day has long passed since
King Charles laughed at the Fel
lows for trying to weigh air. and
since the Fellows tested scientif
ically the theory (false) that young
vipers can be generated from the
powdered livers and lights of old
vipers. But the quest for scientific
truth that brought the Royal So
ciety into being three centuries ago
is being prosecuted as vigorously

Moscow’s Trade Union Building when his es

Reds Get Party Line
On Trial of Powers
LONDON. Aug. iy (AP).—Radio Moscow told the Russian
people today that the facts of Francis Gary Powers’ trial ""pillory
the whole of ruling Washington, which has raised espionage
to the level of state policy.""
The radio's coverage of the trial took two forms.
A factual account was broadcast in English for consump-P
tion abroad. For the home|
audience there was a series of j
Russian-language bu 11 eti n sJ
heavily laced with propaganda.
The Russians were told
Powers' base at Adana, Turkey,
is a place where ""young bloods
are trained for the purpose ot '
committing the villainous pro
vocative flights into the skies!
of foreign countries and in
particular the air space of the
Soviet Union.”
Rocket Claim Revealed
In another Russian-language
broadcast, the radio noted that
Powers testified he was at
68.000 feet at the time of the
explosion which felled his
plane, adding:
""This once again disproves
the mendacious assertion by,
the United States and reaction-,
ary press that Powers’ aircraft
was brought down at a low
altitude. The Soviet rocket
reached the United States air
craft at the maximum altitude
of vfhich it was' capable of
flying.”
In a subsequent home serv
ice broadcast. Powers was de
nounced as ""the bondman of
the Rockefellers and the Mor
gans, of those who turn the
sorrow and tears of mothers
of the world into streams of
gold.”
“With head bowed low, the
spy Powers is sitting in the
dock.” the radio said. ""Reply
ing to questions put to him by 1
the court, this tall man of
athletic build speaks in a,
quiet, faltering little voice, anj
inoffensive little lamb.

Gabon Is Given
Its Independence
LIBREVILLE, Gabon, Aug.
17 (AP).—The small French-
African colony of Gabon—
home of Albert Schweitzer's
jungle hospital—celebrated its
independence today.
The new nation on the West
Coast of Africa is just a little
smaller than the State of
Colorado and has 400,000 in
habitants.
Cultural Affairs Minister
Andre Malraux represented
France at the midnight inde
pendence cermony and read a
message of friendship and
congratulations from President
Charles de Gaulle. A crowd
of about 25,000 gathered to
hear the independence procla
mation read by President Leon
Mba.
Gabon is the 11th member
of the French African com
munity to acquire independ
ence, leaving only Mauretania
still semiautonomous. It is
scheduled for independence in
November.
Contract Bridge
Winners Listed
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17 (AP).
—The summer national mixed
tournament of the American
Contract Bridge League was
won last night by a team of
Mrs. Ralph Kemper of Los
Angeles, Mrs. Betty Ann Welch
of Shreveport. La., George
Rapee and William Grieve, both
of New York.
They led all four sessions,
winning 58 !4 matches.
Second with 54.60 matches
was a team of B. Jay Becker of
New York, Sidney Silodor and
Norman Kay, both of Philadel
phia. Mrs. Dorothy Hayden,
Hastings-on-Hudson, N. Y., and
Mrs. Sylvia Stein. Detroit.
There was a tie for third at

struments showed that the j
plane had crossed the Soviet;
state frontier and insolently!
intruded into the peaceful sky
of our country.
“His hand did not falter I
either when it was pressing the j
buttons of his espionage ap-|
paratus.
j “Nor would the criminal'
hand of Powers falter when
pulling the bomb release lever
if his masters ordered him to
hurl down a deadly nuclear
weapon.
""It is precisely the same sort
, of Powerses, United States air
' men, who turned to ashes Hiro
shima and Nagasaki, annihilat-
I ing scores of thousands of
1 people.”
Background Noted
The broadcast noted that the.
pilot had described himself as
the son of a Virginia cobbler. I
“Powers’ birth certificate no
doubt confirms this fact,” the 1
broadcast said. ""But does an
American cobbler, an American
worker, an American farmer
have any need of war? War,
which Powers undertook to
serve without thinking twice?
""Can a genuine son of a man
of labor voluntarily devote him
self to the cause of preparing
and unleashing a nuclear war?
Can he of his own free will,
without any compulsion, be
; come an accomplice and hire
, ling of the inveterate spy Allien
| Dulles?
! ""No. you are not the son of a
man of. labor. Francis Gary
| Powers. You are the bondman
of the Rockefellers and the
I Morgans.”
EISENHOWER

the accused has been allowed
counsel of his own choosing
and accorded the right to see
representatives of his govern
ment. But the Russians, Mr.
Eisenhower added, had denied
Powers these privileges.
Mr. Eisenhower said he would
not comment in detail on the
trial and the charges because
that might not be helpful to
the flyer. But he spoke out In
dignantly with respect to the
Russian claim that the United
States also is on trial.
He pointed out that the
United States was conducting
the U-2 flights because of what
, he called Russia’s closed so
ciety. Then he referred to Rus
sian boasting of what they
could do.
This does not put the United
States on trial, the President
declared. If they want to put
the President on trial, Mr. Ei
' senhower said, that is their
business.
As for putting him on trial.
I the President told a questioner
they cannot get jurisdiction.
Remarks on Congo
Mr. Eisenhower was re
strained in his comments on
. the explosive situation in the
1 Congo. Asked what should be
1 done if United Nations troops
5 are arrested, the President
[ said:
’ ""You have got conditions
1 that are deplorable and many
- actions are taken impulsively.”
1 The United Nations, he
added, must shoulder its
• responsibility and ""we will sup
port them.”
’ The President indicated that
f if the situation required it he
1 would use some of the foreign
‘ aid contingency fund at his
• disposal through the United
1 Nations to help meet the
t Congo situation.

Kennedy Backs
Broader Care
Senator Kennedy outlined
today the changes he wants
jmade in the medical care
reported to the Senate by the
.Finance Committee.
| In a letter to Senator Ander
j son, Democrat of New Meiico,
a committee member, the Dem
j ocratic presidential nominee
(said the bill “is good as far as
jit goes, but it siipply does not
for far enough and does not
jmeet all of the problems.”
I He told Senator Anderson he
j would join him in sponsoring
an amendment on the Senate
(floor to add a provision grant
ing limited hospital and nurs
ing home care to aged persons
with financing through the so
cial security system.
The amendment is similar to
on erejected by the Finance
Committee last Saturday, 12
to 5. Senator Kennedy’s let
ter to Senator Anderson thus
indicated that a main battle
in the Senate will center on
1 an attempt to reverse the com-
I mittee and put the Anderson
j amendment into the bill.
Senator Kennedy told Sen
ator Anderson:
“I concur in your judgment
1 that we must- have a health
( benefits program financed by
j contributions of a maximum of
j one-quarter of one per cent of
j taxable earnings by employers
, and employes.”
j Senator Kennedy said that
additional tax would be suffi
cient to finance these four
>enefits for persons over 68:
1. Hospitalization up to 120
days.
2. Nursing home care up to
240 days.
3. Nursing and other health
services at home up to 360
days.
4. Out-patient diagnostic
services.

U. S. Radar Fixes
On Venus, Mars
' STOCKHOLM, Aug. 17 (AP).
—A leading Soviet astronomer
says American radar contacts -
with Venus and Mars are pav
, ing the way for the first space
flights to the two planets.
Prof. Alexander Mikhailov,
72. head of the Polkovo Observ
atory near Leningrad, praised
American research methods to
determine precisely the orbits
of the two planets nearest the
earth.
Prof. Mikhailov told a re
porter yesterday that the prob
lem of finding the correct posi
tion of Venus is one of the main
obstacles to sending an auto
matic space vehicle in an orbit
around that planet.
He said that only when exact
relations are established be
tween the earth and Venus or
Mars will it be possible to put
a space vehicle in orbit around
those planets.
Leading space scientists are
here for the 11th International
Astronautical Congress.

Flight of Code Experts
Unveils War of Tapes
BONN, Aug. 17 (NANA).—
The disappearance of the two
United States code experts has
•lifted the curtain cloaking the
weird war of tape recorders
waged by battalions of Ameri
can and Communist cryptog
raphers spotted around the
world.
Bernon F. Mitchell and Wil-1
liam H. Martin, the missing j
men, were employed, it is un
derstood. in the analysis of
monitored Communist trans
missions, mainly code breaking.
They were members of a
world-wide group which has
played a key role in the case
of the U-2 American spy plane,
as well as the cases of the
RB-47 Air Force plane shot
down last month over the
Barents Sea. and the Air Force
Hercules transport shot down
in Soviet Armenia in Septem
ber, 1958.
In each case United States
monitors were able to provide
tape recordings of Soviet com
munications bearing on the
incidents.
Khrushchev Refuted
In the case of Francis G.
Powers, the U-2 pilot, the
United States was able to refute
( Premier Khrushchev's claim
, that a “wonderful Russian
. rocket” had downed the U-2
at its normal operating alti
-1 tude above 75.000 feet.
j Tapes supplied by National
■ Security Agency monitors con
’ tained the voices of Soviet anti
aircraft controllers reporting
Powers’ plane was losing alti
-1 tude and tracing its descent to
( 36.000 feet.
Even more dramatic was the
! case of the Hercules. The NSA
j monitors captured the voices of
Soviet fighter pilots engaged in
, shooting down the unarmed
transport.
Job Is “Fantastic”
j Finally, the NSA is reported
'to have taped similarly Soviet
communications traffic relating
, to the shooting down of the
• RB-47. and these tapes account
for American assurance the
plane was destroyed over inter
national waters.

WAGE
Continued From First Page
I was defeated on his amendment
.; to prevent the Secretary of La
■! bor from regulating wages and
:. working conditions for migra
j tory farm workers. This vote,
however, was not a test of sen
timent on the main issues of
the minimum wage bill.
’ If Senator Holland's second
: amendment is defeated today.
1 other Senators are prepared to
I propose less drastic cutbacks
of coverage.
Backers of the Kennedy bill
expect close votes on some of
' these amendments, but they are
1 counting on what one of them
( called ""the presidential aura""
- to pull them through. Wavering
1 (Democrats will resolve their
’ j doubts in favor of supporting
■ their party's presidential nomi
nee on a key issue, they hope.
1 Nevertheless, Senator Ken-
nedy is prepared to make some
relatively small concessioas on
coverage, but not on the wage
level, to clinch a victory. The
extent of his concessions will
depend largely on how close
the vote is today on the Holland
amendment.
According to informed
| sources, Senator Kennedy is
i thinking tentatively of elimi
nating hotels, restaurants and
auto dealers from his coverage
provisions. This move would re
duce his bill’s coverage exten
sion from 5 million to about 4.6
million, experts said.
Senator Kennedy came to the
floor as the time for voting on
the Holland amendment ap
proached and sat down next to
Senator Clark, Democrat of
Pennsylvania. Senator Clark
announced that Senator Ken
nedy ""has lost his voice and is
scribbling notee to me.”
! Using Senator Clark as his
mouthpiece. Senator Kennedy
i then proceeded to answer ques
(tions from those opposing his
i bill.
The voice problem arose sev
eral times during Senator Ken
j nedy’s primary campaigns. He
j said he is suffering this week
1 from sinus trouble.
Senate Republican Leader
j Dirksen of Illinois plans to pro
! pose a substitute bill if the Hol

1 which would extend coverage to
11.4 million retail workers and
raise the wage floor to $1.15
I for the 23.7 million workers
who now are covered.
But Senator Dirksen is con
sidering expansion of his sub
(stitute to make it conform more
twith the Eisenhower adminis
tration's proposal, which would
extend coverage to about 3.1
million workers and raise the
mnimum wage to $l.lO or $1.15.
Rejects Compromise
Neither Dirksen proposal is
acceptable to Senator Kennedy.
Nor would he accept a com
promise by Senator Monroney.
Democrat of Oklahoma, he said
yesterday.
Senator Monroney would go
along with a $1.25 wage floor,
but would limit coverage of re
tail and service enterprises to
what he calls ""truly interstate”
businesses. He decided yester
day to expand his proposal to
cover about 3.250,000 workers.

estimated his total would in
clude about 19 million workers

Senator Kennedy would cover j
■enterprises ""affecting"" inter-'
instate commerce, even if they!
> are confined to one State. In
j retailing, he would cover any
j 1 store with gross annual sales
1 of at least $1 million.
'l -Senator Monroney proposes
'I to cover retailers only when,
' j they have stores in two or more
States. He has dropped his
1 earlier plan to cover such re
tailers only when they have five
j or more stores and have gross

Difference in Coverage
■ | Senator Monroney would
;; omit coverage of some big local
j stores included in the Kennedy
. j bill, but would cover some rela
’ j tively small businesses excluded
from the Kennedy bill.
’! A key issue is that Senator
’Kennedy would establish a
precedent for coverage of local
‘jstores. Retailers fear that such
’(local coverage would be ex
’ .panded in future years by re
: ‘ duction of the $1 million cut

Democrats Get Backing
Os Another Virginian
WYTHEVILLE, Va„ Oct. 8 (AP).—Attorney General Al
bertis S. Harrison, jr„ tonight pledged his support to the
Democratic presidential ticket and said if the party wins in
November It will measure up to “the duty of decision and the
necessity for action. It has in the past.”
In adding his voice to the growing list of elected Demo
crats, the Attorney General ex-.
pressed the same concerns on it® record had a right to ask

But, said Mr. Harrison, who
is regarded as a probable can

he is a Democrat by inheri

ence and added:
State Preference
“Notwithstanding the appre
hensions and disagreement of
many whose opinions I re
spect, and who are also desir
ous of making a correct de
cision, I shall vote in the com
ing election for the nominee of
the Democratic Party, State
and national.”
Mr. Harrison made his dec
laration in a speech prepared
for delivery at a Wythe County
Democratic rally in the sth
congressional district the
district of Representative Tuck
who along with Senator Byrd
and Representative Smith has
been silent on his presidential
preference.
Mr. Harrison’s address was
far from any ringing reclara- t
tion designed to stir a go
gettem spirit. Rather it was a
dispassionate review of the
problems Southern Conserva
tives faced—from the liberal
tone of both Republicans and
Democratic parties.

Robinson Hit
Over Praise
For Nixon
RICHMOND, Oct. 8 (AP).—
The national NAACP voter reg
istration director today criti
cized former Brooklyn Dodger
baseball star Jackie Robinson
.for his speech indorsing Vice
•President Nixon at the State
NAACP convention last night.
John M. Brooks said Mr.
Robinson did a ""terrible” thing
in urging civil rights propo
nents to support Mr. Nixon,
the Republican presidential
nominee, because of Mr.
Nixon’s “straightforward” ap
proach.
Mr. Brooks said Mr. Robin
son, before the former ball;
player’s speech last night, had
been asked not to inject parti-1
san politics into the rally,
launching the State NAACP’s)
25th annual convention.
Mr. Brooks, addressing a vo
ter registration workshop at'
Virginia Union University, said
the National Association fori
the Advancement of Colored
People is nonpartisan.
In his speech, Mr. Robinson’
described Mr. Nixon as stronger;
on civil rights than Senator ,
Kennedy, his Democratic op-’
ponent.
He told 400 NAACP delegates j
he had received a “straight an
swer from Nixon” on civil
rights but had not from Sena
tor Kennedy. Mr. Robinson is
a national director of the
NAACP and recently was en
listed in the Nixon, campaign
organization.
In other business, Negro
clergymen urged the delegates
to boycott merchants and other
businessmen who do not treat
Negroes fairly. The clergymen
said this practice is in line with’
moral precepts.
They also said racial pride)
“is a false and unpardonable)
notion” and that NAACP work
should “not be done in an!
attitude of bitterness.”
Two other clergymen told the
delegates it is morally wrong!
for voters to reject a political'
candidate for his religious be
liefs.
in expressions of rejection of
those parts of the Democratic
platform dealing with FEPC,
) abolition of literacy tests for
voting and repeal provisions
for the right to work law.
But he equated the Republi
can commission on equal job
opportunity to FEPC and its
requirement for the completion
of six primary grades as a vot
ing prerequisite to the Demo
crats’ recommendation in re
gard to literacy tests.
Not once in his prepared text
did Mr. Harrison mention the
names of Sen. John F. Kennedy
or his Democratic running
mate, Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson.

Kaul, Broyhill
Wax Bitter
In TV Debate
Northern Virginia’s two Con
gressional candidates took their
campaigns to the television
audience yesterday as they
staged their second face-to-face
debate.
■ Democrat Ralph Kaul bitter
ly attacked Republican Repre
sentative Broyhill as an arch
reactionary while Mr. Broyhill
replied with ridicule of candi
dates “who have to resort to
charges, attacks, denunciations
and distortion to cover up their
own weakness.""
The two debated over WTOP
after an angry off-stage argu
ment which almost scuttled the
onstage debate.
Mr. Kaul accused Mr. Broy
hill of misrepresenting North
ern Virginia by voting against
a larger Air Force and Army,
the mutual security program.

Virginia Amendments
Opposed by Defenders
Jack Rathbone, spokesman
for the Arlington Chapter of
the Defenders of State Sover
eignty and Individual Überties,
warned yesterday that a pro
posed amendment to the Vir
ginia Constitution would enable
the Federal Government to de
cide the results of the State
elections.
The suggested amendment
would exempt servicemen from
the State capitation tax, pay
ment of which is a require
ment for voting.
""If they want to move a
troop or regiment out here to
control our elections, they
could do it,” he declared in
urging the County Board to
oppose the amendment.
Mr. Rathbone said his or
ganization is preparing a State
wide campaign, to defeat both i
this amendment and another
which will be submitted to
voters in November.
Mr. Rathbone said he be-
Author Faulkner Named
To Virginia U. Post
CHARLOTTESVILLE. Va..
Oct. 8 (Special). William
Faulkner, Nobel prize-winning
novelist, today was elected by
the Board of Visitors to mem
bership on the University of
Virginia faculty as Emily Clark ’
Balch lecturer on American lit-'
erature.
Under this continuing ap- ’
pointment the Mississippi-born I
author will make one appear
ance each year before the stu-;
dents and faculty. He will also
take part in a limited number ;
of discussion sessions with
classes in American and Eng
lish literature.
I
I for hospitals, parks and control
i of river polution, home rule for
) the District and Statehood for
Hawaii and Alaska.
Mr. Broyhill made few direct
. replies and instead cited spe
) ciflc accomplishments he said
he achieved during his eight
years in Congress.
He said he had supported
legislation authorizing $4O mil
lion in Federal contributions to
Northern Virginia schools, con
struction of four Potomac)
bridges and the Dulles Interna
tional Airport, establishment of
a mass transit authority for the
metropolitan area, benefits for
Federal employes and sewers
which he said would eliminate
97 per cent of the pollution of
)the Potomac.
lieved the capitation tax pro
posal was unconstitutional be
cause civilians would not have
equal rights.
The second amendment would
enable two or more counties,
or counties and cities jointly,
to elect certain local Govern
ment officials.
As the constitution now
stands, each locality must elect
its own treasurer, commission
er of revenue."" clerk. Common
wealth’s attorney and sheriff
or city sergeant.
The change would permit
two or more localities, if a ma
jority of the voters in each
agreed, to elect one official in
each category who would serve
both or all of the localities
participating.
On the second constitutional
question, Mr. Rathbone said it
was ""the opening wedge of
metro government” and would
move the government “farther
away from the people.""
Mr. Faulkner initially came
’ to the University of Virginia as
its first writer-in-residence for
the 1956-7 session and he re
turned for the 1957-8 session
in the same capacity.
The Board of Visitors also
announced election of five per-
I sons as part-time faculty mem

Virginia Boards Urge
Sales Tax for Education
II
111II I ROANOKE. Va., Oct. 8 (AP).
; —The Virginia School Boards
Association today indorsed a
.State sales tax to be used for
i educational purposes.
The sales tax resolution was
part of a six-point program
urged by association members)
from school boards over the
! State.
A sales tax recommended by
Gov. Almond was rejected in
the last session of the General
’ Assembly.
Other resolutions adopted by
the group asked more State
funds for use by local school
districts for school construc
tion, higher pay for teachers,
a clear and equitable formula
for distribution of school
funds, continuation of the Vir
ginia Commission on Public
Education and broader studies
into educational uses of tele
vision and other modern schol
astic tools.
Dr. Joy Installed
Dr. Barnard Joy of Arlington
took over tonight as president
of the organization, succeeding
Mrs. Bess Willis Shrader of
Amherst.
W. M. Gravatt, jr., of Notto
way County, was named presi
dent-elect of the association to
day at its annual convention.
Elected today to the execu
tive board were Henry C. Reed,
chairman of the Martinsville
School Board; Francis J. Co
penhaver of Smyth County
School Board, and W. Roy Brit
ton of the South Norfolk School
Board.
Dr. George W. Holmes HI, of
Charlottesville will continue as
executive secretary.
In an address last night, the
chairman of the Richmond i
City School Board said the ’
State’s school desegregation :
dispute cut into the power of <
■ local school boards and -In
> creased the role of State and
legislative bodies in school af
fairs.
“Unwelcome Trend” Charged
Lewis F. Powell said he in
tended no criticism of such
State laws as the pupil place
ment act and the scholarship
law.
“I merely suggest that they
do detract from the independ
ence and authority of local
boards, and this in itself is
an unwelcome trend,” Mr.
Powell said.
Yesterday a city school board
member charged that Virgin
ia’s rural counties are drag
ging their feet in the matter
of local financial support of
public schools.
Lester I. Bowman, chairman
of the Petersburg school board,
said the rural counties are not
; assessing real estate high
enough and thereby are not
exerting enough local effort.-
Mr. Bowman made the com
; ment during a panel discussion
after Francis J. Copenhaver.
Smyth County School Board
chairman, said the State should
bear a larger share of the
| school costs.
Mr. Copenhaver said the dis
parity in teacher salaries from
one locality to another is get
ting wider. He said. too. indus
try is moving to city areas and
thus helping to support those
schools, leaving country folk
holding the bag. .’ vr ,

as to what the second portion
of the First Amendment in
tended, namely ""prohibiting

HOWEVER, THERE is dis
agreement by some concern
ing the interpretation of the
first part of the Amendment
centered around the question
oI just what the framers of
the Constitution meant in

The fact that parochial

serves as a springboard for

RECOGNITION DINNER:
Bishop Honors
DDF Workers
Bishop Issenmann will honor the laymen in the
Diocese who have distinguished themselves as mem
ber of the Diocesan family through their participation
in the Annual Diocesan Development Fund drives at a
reception and dinner Sunday at Bishop Hartley High
School.
The Recognition Day festiv
ities will get under way at 3
p.m.
INVITATIONS from the
Bishop were sent to 186 lay
men, including the general
lay chairmen, deanery and
parish chairmen who took
part in the DDF drives in 1959
and 1960. All the priests of
the Diocese have been invited
to attend.
Monsignor Bennett Apple
gate,' Diocesan Superintend
ent of Schools and 1960 Gen
eral Clergy Chairman, will
open the program with a gra
phic report on film showing
pertinent factors of the previ
ous DDF drives, such as the

FROM SUNDAY COLLECTION:
Last year the tangible re

amounted to $42,000. The Holy
Father distributes 51 per cent
of the Mission Sunday alms

per cent to the Oriental Mis

40 per cent among the home
missions as recommended by
the board of American bish

FOURTH OF SERIES:
Bus Transportation and the First Amendment
THE OPPONENTS of trans
o a i o n o n o n u i
school children argue that
public tax money is being
u s e o s u o u
schools and thus violate the
alleged guarantee of separa
tion of church and state of
the First Amendment.
In the Everson Decision,
which was decided some 12
years ago, the Supreme Court
broadly interpreted the clause
of the First Amendment for
bidding the establishment of
religion, saying ""neither a
state nor the federal govern
ment can pass laws which aid
one religion, aid all religions,
or prefer one religion over
another."" But in examining
the New Jersey law, in light
of this interpretation, the
Court reasoned that other
I n o u i s u s s i o n o
Church-state relationship,
there are unchanging
principles which we must
keep and cherish but the
way these principles are ap
plied can change as the situa
tion changes, Monsignor Rol
*and T. Winel told the dele
gates to the 15
th annual
Council of Catholic Women's
meeting here Tuesday.
""THERE ARE BASIC Chris
sources which we ac-
Lay
ment"" of those involved in
the DDF drives, will also he
presented. The Diocesan cast
includes William Faller as the
narrator Paul Weisenbach as
St. Peter John Morrison as

the Angel William Garrett as

""Mr. 1959 Chairman Rob
ert Griffin as ""Mr. 1960 Chair

FOLLOWING THE presen
tation of the skit the Bishop
will present certificates, with
his official seal, to the chair
men. The program will con
clude with dinner being serv
ed in the school cafeteria.
The Bishop will then meet
his permanent DDF Board of
Advisors.
Missioners Here,

Mission Sunday is observed October 16th in the
Diocese and the special oration from the Mass for the
Propagation of the Faith will be added in all Masses
of this Sunday.

preached on the Missions re
questing prayers, sacrifices
and vocations, and that a spe

all Masses. Participation by
all the faithful in the Mission
work of the Church has always
been understood as springing
from theology?
In 1922 it was crystallized in
the October Mission Sunday
observance by Pope Pius XI
Who launched many of the
newer mission programs of

Kennedy Elected in Tight Finish,
Nixon Concedes, Urges Unity
Kennedy Wins
Maryland With'
Edge ofBo,ooo
Republicans Gain
One House Seat
In Record Vote
By PAUL HOPE
Star Staff Writer
Senator Kennedy rolled up
nearly an 80,000 margin in
Maryland as the Free State
Joined the Democratic presi
dential column yesterday for
the first time since 1944.
With all precincts reported,
returns showed a record num
ber of Maryland voters turned
out to give the Democratic
candidate a vote of 559,748 to
481,365 for Vice President
Nixon. In addition, there were
about 15,000 absentee ballots
which won’t be counted until
the official canvass Thursday.
Only one Republican con
gressional candidate—Charles
(Mac) Mathias in the 6th dis
trict—was able to break into
the State’s formerly all-Demo
cratic bloc in the House of
Representatives.
Unofficial returns from the
6th district gave Mr. Mathias,
a Frederick lawyer and member
of the State House of Delegates,
a vote of 112,534 to Democratic
Representative Foley’s 103,720.
Lankford Wins Easily
Representative Lankford,*
Democrat, won easily in the
sth district over Republican
Carlyle J. Lancaster, a Prince
Georges lawyer. The vote was
119,533 to 71,880.
The other five Democrats re
elected to Congress were Rep
resentatives Fallon, Garmatz
and Friedel in Baltimore City;
Brewster in the 2nd district,
and Johnson in the Ist district
on the Eastern Shore. All won
easily except Mr. Johnson who
came out victorious over former i
Republican Congressman Ed- i
ward T. Miller by a vote of
41,958 to 35,933.
In the presidential race, it
was a whopping 88.0Q0 ma
jority in Baltimore City which
gave Mr. Kennedy Maryland’s
nine electoral votes. As ex
pected, Mr. Nixon picked up
more votes in the counties than
Senator Kennedy, but the Dem
ocrats were able to hold down
the margin even there.
Montgomery for Kennedy
Montgomery County, which
gave President Eisenhower a 1
14,000-vote margin in 1956, |
moved over to the Democratic
column yesterday by a vote of
64.077 for Senator Kennedy to
60,212 for Mr. Nixon. This was!
the first presidential election
since 1940 in which Montgom
ery has voted Democratic.
Prince Georges, one of the
mainstays of the Democratic
party in Maryland, gave Sena
tor Kennedy 61,369 to Mr.
Nixon’s 44,203.
In big Baltimore County,
where the Republicans had ex
pected to pile up a sizable
margin, the G.O.P. managed to
eke out only a slim edge in a
vote of 94,979 to 93,749.
The other suburban county,
Anne Arundel, gave Mr. Nixon
an edge by a vote of 30,133 to
25.767.
Here are the counties which
went for Mr. Nixon: Allegany,
Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Caro
line, Carroll, Cecil, Frederick,
Garrett, Harford, Howard, Kent,
Somerset, Talbott, Washington,
Wicomico and Worcester.
Besides Baltimore City, Sena
tor Kennedy won in these coun
ties: Calvert, Charles, Dor

Nixon Swings Virginia
To Republicans Again
By ALEX R. PRESTON
Star Staff Writer
Vice President Nixon won
Virginia’s 12 electoral votes yes
terday when the State voted
Republican for the third
straight time.
Not since 1924 had Virginia
been on the losing side in a
presidential race.
Yesterday’s outcome was the
result largely of Democrats
fighting one another. Its effect
is virtually certain to be felt
in an equally bitter struggle
for the party nomination for
Governor next year.
Unofficial results in all but
23 of 1,947 precincts gave:
Nixon: 396,969.
Kennedy: 356,105.
A Conservative Party ticket,
headed by C. Benton Coiner,
pledged to cast its electoral
votes for Senator Byrd, Demo
crat of Virginia, polled slightly
more than 3,000 votes.
Broyhill Defeats Kaul
Voters returned to office the
eight Democratic and two Re
publican members to the House
of Representatives.
The closest races were in the
nearby 10th District, where Re
publican Representative Broy
hill was re-elected by about a
11,700-vote majority over
Democrat Ralph Kaul, and in
Kennedy's Majority
Appears No Mandate
By DAVID S. BRODER
Star Staff Writer
A victory without a verdict
and a majority without a man
date were Senator Kennedy’s
today as the final returns
trickled in from the closest
presidential election since 1916.
The American people, on the
basis of these returns, gave
him the power and responsi
bility he had asked for, but
doled out their favor so spar
ingly that he immediately con
fronted a problem of making
his achievement more substan
tial than it looked on paper.
If he shared a bit of Vice
President Nixon’s disappoint
ment at the outcome of yester
day’s voting, it would be un
derstandable.
For Mr. Nixon, the reason
for gloom was obvious enough:
The brilliant political career
that carried him in 14 years
from a back seat in the House
of Representatives to the verge
of the presidency—this career
was ended by his failure to
persuade a minute additional
proportion of the electorate to
support his cause.

other hand, could take satis-

Senator Robertson, Democrat,

ment to exempt members of the

Margin Less Than Forecast
Mr. Nixon’s victory fell short
of the 70,000-vote majority
forecast by his most powerful
backers in Virginia, an organi
zation known as Democrats for
Nixon-Lodge.
At an early hour today, when
outcome of the national con
test still was inconclusive, Eu

Democrats for Nixon-Lodge,

faction from the fact that at
43 he apparently had become
the youngest man in history
and the first of his faith to be
elected President of the United
States.
It was a notable achievement
by a man who had overcome,
in succession, the opposition
of the elders of his own party
and of an entrenched and pop
ular President.

against Senator Kennedy’s
nomination and election were
astronomical, and he beat the
odds.
Yet, for one who had con
sciously patterned his cam
paign on that Franklin Delano
Roosevelt conducted in 1932,
seeking a mandate to “move
this country forward to a New
Frontier” like Roosevelt’s New
Deal, the outcome must have
been something of a letdown.
True, he had. by appealing
strongly to party loyalty and
party sentiment, restored the
voting pattern to that of the
pre-Eisenhower years and re
constructed the old ""Roosevelt
coalition” resting on northern

Nixon Pledges
Full Support
Wires Kennedy
Congratulations
By CECIL HOLLAND
„ Star Bteff Writer
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 9— Vice
President Nixon, fighting to the
last, finally gave up today.
The defeated Republican
presidential candidate conceded
the election to Senator Kennedy
and sent this wire shortly be
fore 10 a.m. to the successful
Democratic leader at Hyannis
Port, Mass.:
“I want to repeat through
this wire the congratulations
and best wishes that I extended
to you on television last night.
“I know you will have the
united support of all Americans
as you lead the Nation in the
cause of peace and freedom in
the next four years.”
The capitulation was an
nounced by Herbert G. Klein,
Mr. Nixon’s press secretary,
after Mr. Nixon told a televi
sion audience early this morn
ing that if the trend continued
Senator Kennedy would be the
next President of the United
States.
Described as Philosophical
Mr. Klein and Mr. Nixon de
cided only about an hour be
fore he sent the telegram that
he had no chance to overtake
Senator Kennedy.
Mr. Klein described the de
feated Republican candidate
as in “very good spirits” and
as philosophical about the out
come.
Mrs. Nixon, he said, also ac-

Key Stocks Dip
In Lively Trading
NEW YORK, Nov. 9 (AP).—
The stock market definitely
turned weak around noon to
day after a mixed earlier trend.
Selling picked up a bit follow
ing a statement by the Repub
lican national chairman that
it seemed to him Senator Ken
nedy had been elected Presi
dent.
Trading was lively.
Steels, motors, chemicals,
coppers and some electronics
were hit by the selling. Losses
ran to about $2 in key stocks,
much more in others.
Aircrafts scored small gains,
i Gold shares advanced earlier,
then turned mixed.
Commodities displayed
strength, although not holding
their best gains. Cotton was
among the strongest commodi
ties. Wool also moved ahead.
Wheat and soybeans lost a
good part of an earlier advance.

PIGGY-BACK FOR CAROLINE
Kennedy Marks Time
On Nantucket Beach
By MARY McGRORY
Btkr Staff Writer
HYANNIS PORT, Mass., Nov. 9.—President-Elect John
F. Kennedy made his first appearance today since his eye
! lash election victory on the wind-swept lawn of his father’s
house overlooking Nantucket Sound.
He looked relaxed and happy, and he was holding his
I 3-year-old daughter Caroline by the hand. Caroline held
out her arms. When he picked
her up she demanded a piggy
back twice, and the new Pres
ident swung her on his back.
As his brother Ted emerged
from the house, one of three
Kennedy homes in the plot,
Senator Kennedy said to him.
""How about a walk along the
beach, Teddy?” As they started
' down the sandy path that leads
! through dune grass to the sea,
1 other members of the family
who had been playing touch
football, the Kennedy family
game, on lawns and beach
| front, gathered.
Marking Time
| The time was 12:15, and the
new President was still marking
time before claiming the vic
tory not yet conceded to him
by* his rival, Vice President
! Nixon.
All morning long there had
! been endless coming and going
among the three houses that
! are strung along the beach
here. In his brother Bobby’s
house, staff members and re
porters were being served

■ by a landslide in final un

Gov. Munoz Marin, himself a

The results of the record poll

bishops, who in pastoral letters
1 had warned that a vote for
?Gov. Munoz Marin’s Popular
s Democrats would be a sin be-
■ cause the party did not oppose

• By re-electing Gov. Munoz
'• Marin, the voters also approved
Puerto Rico’s continuance as

Minnesota Is State
To Clinch Victory
Over Republicans
Margin at Polls 50.4% to 49.6%
In Closest Balloting Since 1916
By J. A. O’LEARY
Btxr Staff Writer
John F. Kennedy, the Democratic nominee, won the
presidential election today.
He is the youngest man and the first Roman Catholic
ever elected to the Nation’s highest office.
The handsome, 43-year-old Massachusetts Senator
defeated 47-year-old Vice President Nixon in the deftest
national election since 1916.
Minnesota ended the hours of uncertainty early this
afternoon by finally putting its 11 electoral votes in the
Kennedy column. This brought his total to 272—three more
than the 269 required for election. Illinois’ 27 votes appeared
ready to follow.
Senator Kennedy’s victory had seemed apparent through-

briefly and formally today on ;
his election victory an I began
the cheerless task of turning

Telegram Text
To the forty-three-year-old
Democrat who will take over
his job, Mr. Eisenhower said:
“My congratulations to you
I for the victory.you have just
won at the poll§. I will be
sending you promptly a more
comprehensive telegram sug- h
gesting certain measures that
’ may commend themselves to
you as you prepare to take over
next January the responsibili

5 Press Secretary James C.

1 would work on the draft of a
■ \ second telegram to Senator
> Kennedy aboard his plane as
> he flies to Augusta. Ga„ this
! afternoon for a golfing vaca
tion. This telegram will prob-

: Mr. Eisenhower met with his

, of planning the transition of
• his administration to Senator
Kennedy. His more detailed
message to the President-elect
will reflect some of the sugges-
s tions made at the cabinet meet
. ing, Mr. Hagerty said.
Warmer Tone
f Mr. Eisenhower’s telegram to
i Senator Johnson, an old friend
; despite their political differ
rences, was somewhat wanner
j 1 than that to Senator Kennedy.
■ Addressed to the Vice Pres-
■ ident-elect in Austin, Tex., it
reads:
I “The American people have
spoken. Congratulations and
best wishes on your victory as
Vice President-elect.”
Mr. Eisenhower had thrown
his full prestige into the G. O. P.
effort to put Mr. Nixon in the
, White House, and his message
of condolence to the Vice
t President was to a comrade
r in arms with whom he shared
} the pain of defeat.
It read:
“Your hard-fought, courage

of deep personal satisfaction
2 to have served closely with you

out the night, but there had I
remained the mathematical I
possibility that Mr. Nixon could I
overtake him by taking several 1
undecided States.
Nixon Wires Concession
A few minutes after the Min- I
nesota results were flashed I
across the country, Mr. Nixon I
formally conceded in a tele
gram to Senator Kennedy and
urged national unity. He had
made only a conditional con
cession in a talk to his support
ers in Los Angeles last night.
California and Illinois were
still undecided, but leaning to
Senator Kennedy. It was the
uncertainty over California
that had kept a faint ray of
hope alive for Republicans
during the night. But the loss
lof Minnesota to the Demo
crats extinguished this hope
and made the final outcome in
California academic.
Before Minnesota went to
the Democrats an Associated
Press tabulation had given
Kennedy 21 other States with
265 electoral votes. Minnesota
! brought him up to 276. If he
maintains his present lead in
California. Illinois and Alaska
l the victor would end up with
338 votes.
Mr. Nixon has 20 States with
164 electoral votes, knd is lead
ing in foui- others with 21 more,
namely, Arizona, Montana,
New Mexico and Washington.
These could give Mr. Nixon
185.
i 14 Electors Unpledged
There are 14 unpledged Dem
ocratic electors in Mississippi
and Alabama, who might have
played a dramatic role in the
electoral college voting next
, month if Senator Kennedy had
, riot accumulated the required
. majority of 269 without them.
Now their final decision will be
i immaterial. Some Southern
i leaders had supported un
pledged electors in the hope
that neither major candidate
would win a majority.
In popular vote for the
Kennedy-Nixon race is closer
; than the dramatic 1916 finish,
when Woodrow Wilson, Demo
: crat, ran only 591,385 votes
• ahead of Charles Evans Hughes,
■ Republican. With many pre-
I cincts still uncounted in Cali
, fornia and Illinois, Mr. Nixon
. has narrowed Senator Ken
. nedy’s popular vote margin
down to 469,194.
In crucial California Senator
Kennedy was clinging this
i morning to a lead of about
[ 52,000 out of a total vote of
. more than 4,300,000. In that
• State there are some 90,000
. absentee ballots which may be
counted as late as next Monday.

Durant Leaders Hear
About New Company
Representatives of Missis
sippi Industries, Inc. explained
the workings and purposes of
their organization to Durant
civic leaders at a luncheon at
the Hotel Durant last Thurs
day.
Henry Maddox of Jackson,
Assistant to me President o
the newly former organization,
told the leaders that Missis
sippi Industries was formed
so that Mississippians could
have ownership in manufact
uring plants and other indust
rial development in the state.
“Our efforts in the past
have been to go out and lure
industries into the state and
in many instances these new
industries have been the life
blood of the area, but present
ly less than 10 per cent of the
manufacturing in the state is
owned and controlled by citi
zens of Mississippi,” Maddox
Emphasizing the need for
the “right kind of people” if
the organization is to succeed,
he noted that Hugh White is
Chairman of the Board of the
company. Warren Hood is
president of the organization
The company is interested
in starting small industries for
which there is a need through
out the state and advisory
groups would be formed in
communities where there were
sufficient stockholders, it was
explained.
These advisory groups would
make suggestions as to the
feasigility of locating plants
in their towns and then ex
perts employed by the com
pany would test these pro
posed sites to see if it would
be advisable to develop them.
A question and answer per
iod followed the discussion.

Difference
To Depend
On Spirit
The “game of the year”
for both Lexington and Du
rant is scheduled Friday
night when the two arch
rival Holmes County squads
collide in their annual grudge
grid game at Lexington’s
Beall Field. Game time is
7:30 o’clock.
JDuui b4uaus nave uecn
practicing daily this week in
preparation for the all-im
portant season finals and are
expected to be in top shape.
On paper, Coach Dale
Brasher’s Tigers hold the
edge, but past performances
can usually be thrown out
the window when the two long
time rivals meet.
The Tigers have rolled up
391 points to lead the state
high school scoring race in
posting wins over eight op
ponents with only a 7-7 tie
with Union marring their sea
son’s record. They have al
lowed 26 points to be scored
against them.
Durant has defeated Mc
Adams, 41-0; Tchula, 32-6;
Kilmichael, 13-6; Vaiden, 64-0;
Itta Bena, 34-0; Ethel 56-7;
North Carrollton, 41-0; and
Brandon, 47-0.
Coach Brasher was quick
to point out this week, how
ever, that the last time Du
rant played the Hornets on
Beall Field Lexington scored
an impressive 47*6 victory.
Coach Woodson Earle’s Hor
nets have amassed a 5-3 rec
ord this season after getting
off to a slow start. Lexington
has scored 188 points to 104
for the opposition.
The Hornets have defeated
Vaiden, 36-0; McAdams 18-0;
Moorhead, 36-14; Ethel 39-21
and Tchula, 26-13.
Lexington setbacks have
been administered by North
Carrollton, Kilmichael, and
Jackson St. Joseph.
Six seniors will end their
high school career for Durant
including Tackle Wesley Lep
ard, Guard Dale Lewis, End
Larry Ellis, End; Johnny Vau

j Too Costly for Sewer
By JACK KELSO
Star Staff Writer
Fairfax County, after consulting with an engineering
Arm. has decided its suggested Route 7 path for the Dulles
Airport sewer line would be too expensive.
The county «® es before the Washington Regional Metro
politan Conference today with a recommendation for the
route along the Potomac River, with a positive stipulation that
spur lines be built into the
county.
Mrs. Anne Wilkins, chair
. man of the Fairfax supervisors,
f won a two-week delay on action
"" on the sewer line at the last
- session of the sanitary board.)
t The county used the time sor’
a quick study of sewer line pos-
. sibilitiea
> Fairfax has been opposed to
{ the river route, proposed by the
District Sanitary Engineering
t Department, because the county
f feared it would be left without
* access to the . interceptor line.
County officials had sug-
* gested that a path along Route
* 7 might be cheaper and would
» serve the county better.

the board decided the Route 7

VIRGINIA VOTES TO EXEMPT
SERVICEMEN FROM POLL TAX
RICHMOND, Va. (AP).—Virginia voters overwhelm
ingly approved a constitutional amendment on Tuesday
permitting members of the armed forces, in peace as
well as In war, to vote without paying a poll tax.
Still in doubt, however, was the fate of another
amendment on the ballot which would permit counties,
or adjoining cities and counties, to employ constitutional
officers on a joint basis.
When tabulation on the poll tax amendment was
halted Tuesday night, with about two-thirds of the
State’s 1,947 prectncis reported, it was being indorsed
by more than 100,000 votes.
The second amendment won no such favor. On the
basis of returns from 1,426 precincts, It was being re
jected. The vote at that juncture was 204.482 against,
203,416 for.

To Life for Rape
SALEM, Va.. Nov. 10 (AP).— '
A 19-year-old Salem resident
was sentenced to a life term in
prison yesterday on a charge i
of raping a 26-year-old mother
of five children.
Herbert Lee Rucker pleaded
guilty to the charge in Roanoke
County Circuit Court.
The attack occurred October

Girl, 18, Walks
9 Miles Because
Nixon Lost t
ROANOKE, Va.,Nov. 10 (AP).
—Eighteen-year-old Jenny Lou
Dawson took a hike yesterday
—nine miles.
Jenny Lou's troubles began
Tuesday when,John Edmund,
who lives at Westward Lakes
in Roanoke County, contacted
the Salem Republican head
quarters.
""I’d like to make a bet with
a Salem Republican,” he said.
“If one of you will promise to
hike to Roanoke from Salem if
Nixon loses. I'll promise to do
the same—backwards—if Ken
nedy loses.”
z Mr. Edmund says there were
half a dozen men in the Salem
Republican center. But no one
would accept his bet.
Then along came Jenny Lou,
a staunch Republican, even
though she’s too young to vote.
She showed up at the Salem
Democratic headquarters on
Main street yesterday, ready to
begin her trek.

Gracious Good-Bye
President Eisenhower’s final news
conference was a pleasantly relaxed
affair.
Although the elght-year record of
such meetings shows that Mr„ Eisen
hower met the newsmen and women
fewer times and more Irregularly than
did his immediate Democratic prede
cessors, Franklin Roosevelt and Harry
Truman, it likewise shows very few
occasions of anything approaching un
pleasant or embarrassing exchanges.
And if Mr. Eisenhower did not often
display as much relish for tilting with
the correspondents as his predecessors,
it is worth noting that the conference
practice itself was brought to a new
high level of public usefulness. For the
first time, for example, verbatim tran
scripts were made available quickly
after the conferences, with the privilege
of direct quotation.
It is a questionable innovation,
Incidentally, which President-elect Ken
nedy is proposing in the holding of “live”
news conferences before the television
cameras. Undoubtedly there will be no
lack of public interest in such meetings.
But we think there is serious doubt that
a Chief Executive in a spontaneous
question-and-answer session can guard
against an inadvertent word or gesture
that might be misinterpreted by the
viewing audience with potentially harm
ful result. Even a “no comment” in some
circumstances can be translated into a
variety of meanings—here and abroad.
To return to Mr. Eisenhower’s fare
well, it was in keeping with his currently
mellow mood on the eve of retirement.
Again, as he did on the previous evening,
he wished “Godspeed” to his successor
and expressed, satisfaction at the
smoothness of the transition from one
administration to another. His concern
that this periodic transfer of power
should be accomplished efficiently and
harmoniously was reflected in his
interesting proposal that it might be
wise to advance election and inaugural
dates, by constitutional amendment, to
give an incoming President more time
to prepare plans and programs for a
new Congress. Os his personal plans,
it was in keeping also with the record
of his lifetime that he implied a willing
ness to serve Nation or party further if
it seemed in the public Interest.
For their part, it was evident that
the near-record number of assembled
correspondents were in a mood respon
sive to the President's own. Figuratively,
we join them in their applause at this
final “Thank you, Mr. President.”
New Man at Justice
As most people expected, and as we
•think should have been the case, the
nomination of Robert Kennedy as
Attorney General sailed smoothly
through the sometimes stormy waters
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Except for a bit of Republican heckling,
the much-advertised “hearing” on his
nomination turned out to be pretty
much of a love feast. The consensus
was, and, in fact, had to be that this
young man’s qualifications as the
Nation’s chief legal officer would be
judged, not on his record, which is
negligible, but on the basis of his per
formance, which we hope will be of a
high order.
This hope certainly finds support in
the experience of the outgoing Attorney
General, William Pierce Rogers. When
Bill Rogers came to the Justice Depart
ment as Deputy Attorney General in
1953 he was older, but not much older,
than Bobby Kennedy is now. He had
had more experience in the practice
of law, but one would hardly say that
the Rogers star had shone so brightly
as to overwhelm and dim the light of
his contemporaries at the bar. Never
theless, as he prepares to step aside at
the still youthful age of 47, we have
no doubt as to the nature of the
Informed judgment respecting his
career as Attorney General. It will be
that he has served with distinction.
The reason, or at least the primary
reason, is that Attorney General Rogers
has devoted himself to serving and
furthering the cause of justice. It
follows necessarily that he has not used
his position to pay political debts or to
inflict political punishments. Although
a close friend and warm supporter of
Richard Nixon, he has not attempted
to use his office to promote eithbr his
friend’s or his own political fortunes.
Instead, to repeat, he has devoted him
self with notable efficiency to the job at
hand—the fair and vigorous adminis-
tration of justice. If Bobby Kennedy
does as well, those who have complained
of his youth, his Inexperience, nepotism,
or what have you, will find themselves
with a large self-serving of words to eat.
Mr. K. and Our Coil
Although It must remain constantly
on guard against the ever-present threat
of Communist subversion and aggres
sion, the free world has reason to view
with great calm, if not contempt, Nikita
Khrushchev’s assertion that the day is
""not far off” when Red totalitarianism
will conquer and rule the entire globe.
After all, the ebullient Soviet
dictator has long since demonstrated
that his crystal ball is more than a
little bit clouded. At any rate, he has
looked at it in the past and seen things
in it that were not really there. Thus,
to cite but one example of his faulty
clairvoyance, he has repeatedly pre
dicted that agriculture in the USSR
would by this time be equalling or ex
ceeding our own country’s tremendous
farm output. Actually, however, the
Russian economy in that respect con
tinues to lag far behind ours—enough
so to constitute a potential crisis in view
of the fact that Russia’s fast-multi
plying population is sharply out of pace
with the food supply.
But this failure of his agricultural
forecasts apparently has not discouraged
,Mr. Khrushchev from predicting that
the whole earth—including the United
States —will soon be under the mastery
of communism. This will be brought
about, he has suggested, not by all-out
war, but by a system of ""peaceful co
existence” under which the Red total!-,
tariani will win control of everything
everywhere—north, east, south and west
—throughout this mortal coil we call
our world. Presumably, the sheer charm
• of Soviet agents will speed up the con
quest, but if that is not enough, then the
military power of the USSR—as Mr. K.
has hinted, with the subtlety of a
sledge-hammer—will be used against
any “capitalist” power (meaning espe
cially our own country) daring to resist
the forces of Communist “liberation.”
In setting forth this thesis in the
20,000-word speech that has just been
published in Moscow, Mr. Khrushchev
. has had some interesting things to say
about war. He does not like the idea of
a big nuclear conflict. He does not like
it because he thinks it would be as bad
for the Soviet Union as for the United
States. Nor does he like “brush-fire”
fights that could lead to a major ex
plosion. Indeed, as far as shooting is
concerned, the only thing he seems to
favor is the “liberation” struggle—as in
Algeria and Cuba—where the so-called
“revolutionary” forces, if not actually
in cahoots with the Kremlin, are strongly
inclined to serve it.
In that sense, of course, the wars
of “liberation” are limited strictly to
those who fight only for the USSR.
Certainly, as mankind has seen, with a
feeling of shock and disgust, people in
countries like Hungary and Tibet
struggle for liberty only at the risk of
being destroyed by the forces of Com
munism. Naturally enough, Mr. Khru
shchev has said nothing about this and
his silence on it is supremely eloquent.

The Cost of Fringes
It has become almost universal in
labor-management contract negotia
tions that a package of so-called fringe
benefits figures importantly at the
bargaining table. Although frequently
stated in terms that make these seem
relatively insignificant, their cumula
tive cost in dollars has become
astonishingly heavy. Some, such as
employer payments to the social
security system, are Imposed by law
and are not subject to negotiation.
Others are arrived at by direct bar
gaining.
The National Industrial Conference
Board has drawn an interesting statis
tical picture of how all these supple
ments to wages and salaries—outlays
by employers—have mounted sharply
during the past quarter of a century
to approximately $lB billion in 1960. At
this level, they represented 7.4 per cent
of the $243 billion paid by Industry in
wages, salaries and supplements. In
1935, the total was about $5OO million—
or slightly more than 1 per cent of
total outlays to personnel. And while
employer payments to social security
amounted to $5.2 billion last year, it is
notable that employer contributions to
private pension and welfare funds—
often subject to negotiation—totalled
$8.5 billion.
This is a cost to industry that prob
ably will continue to rise and is in fact
accepted with increased willingness by
management. Nevertheless, the paying
of it constitutes a burden which all too
often goes unappreciated.
'To Your Health'
Next to the weather, probably no
subject of conversation is more dear to
the American heart than health— one’s
own, that of others and more recently
that of whoever happens to be the Presi
dent of the United States. Mr. Eisen
hower’s for example, has provided
material for interminable discussion
and, it might be added incidentally,
for warm congratulations at this
moment.
So it is that the two young men,
both in their forties, who were com
peting last fall for the prize of White
House tenancy felt compelled to pro
duce something in the nature of a*
doctor’s certificate that they were sound
of mind and body. It is, of course, a
good thing to be so, and now that John
F. Kennedy of Massachusetts is about to
live in the “goldfish bowl” at 1600 Penn
sylvania avenue we are pleased and
ready to accept the verdict reported in
a publication of the American Medical
Association that he is in “superb physi-
• cal condition.” He looks fit to us, and
we hope he stays that way.

LETTERS TO THE STAR
Dealing With Russia
The theme of Bruce Cat
ton’s articles on “The Need
less War,” if I read their in
tent correctly, was that had
there been some kind of com
promise prior to the Civil
War it might never have
happened.
I hope I am again reading
Mr. Catton correctly when I
gather that he is saying that
in order to avoid a war that
will “envelope civilization In
earthquake, wind and fire,”
we should compromise with
Soviet Russia and come to
an agreement on doing
away with all nuclear weap
ons.
I do not agree with Mr.
Catton that “compromise is
what enables democracy to
work.” A democracy cannot
survive when it compromises
with truth, freedom, honor,
courage and loyalty. Com
promise is only meant for
use In less important matters.
The United States rejected
slavery and agreed whole
heartedly with Lincoln that
a nation cannot live half
free and half-slave. But in
1933 we abandoned that
principle when wa recognized
Soviet Russia, a nation ruled
by masters over its slave
citizens.
No longer Is compromise
spurned over slavery; we
now shut our eyes to the fact
that there can be no peace
in a world half-free and
half-alave. We have aban
doned the slaves behind the
Iron Curtain In preference
to helping the “backward
peoples” of the world.
Compromising with the
Georgia's Resistance to School Integration
Your editorial “Showdown
in Georgia,” points out that
Gov. Vandiver has no reason
to doubt what the future
holds. It says “He ought to
know in this matter of
school desgregation the fu
ture holds for Georgia pre
cisely what it has held for
other States—nothing more,
nothing less. That Georgia
faced with a final court order
has one of two choices: Obey
the order or close Its public
schools.""
But the editorial over
looked a third choice which
Georgia has. namely, the
legislature can declare that
what is purported to be a
ruling of the United States
Supreme Court in Brown vs.
Board of Education et al, is
not a constitutionally au
thorized ruling of the court,
and hence Is unconstitu
tional, invalid, and not law
within the jurisdiction of the
State. The ruling Is beyond
the authority granted, in
that the members of the
court have attempted to ex
ceed their constitutional
power which is limited under
the provisions of article 111
.Jo “judicial power.”
Georgia, one of the orginal
13 Colonies, was a signatory
to the Constitution of the
United States. The power
which the Supreme Court
enjoys was conferred upon it
by these 13 original States.
Therefore, the Supreme
Court is a creature of the
States. No authority can be
found in the Constitution
whereby power was conferred
upon the court in the mat
ters relating to public edu
cation.
The public school systems
in the States operate by vir
tue of their respective con
stitutions. It is entirely up to
a State whether it will or
will not provide a public
school system. All that a
State has to do is to amend
its constitution, and it would
be out of the public school
business. What then would
be the position of the court?
Would it have the authority
to compel a State to operate
a public school system? The
answer is that it has no such
power. This places the court
in a rather strange position.
While having no original
jurisdiction over the estab
lishment of schools in a
State, yet it can step in and
control the schools once the
State has made provision for
them.

Noxious Bus Fumes

Norman DeNeale.
There is nothing social about
it.”
Parents, as we are. know
that school, any proper kind
of school, has a great deal
that is social about it.
Children meet other chil
dren with whom they talk
and become acquainted, in
vite to their homes, and as a
result of making these social
friendships, go to school
social gatherings together,
and to parties, elsewhere.
How about the school
dances, fraternities, sororities,
picnic, time spent together
during recess, and the lunch
periods? These are not social?
Perhaps Mr. McGills
thought is that the children
enter the school building like
little robots, sit in classes
looking neither to right, or
left, and then again, like
robots, march home.
To say that Mr. McGill
favors integration in the
schools, is an understate
ment; but let’s have truth
along with it and recognition
of the realities as they exist.

Georgia Gov. Ernest Van
diver’s unwarranted clamor
concerning the admittance of
two Negro students to the
University of Georgia has
paid off. The students were
suspended and the liberal
minded Governor gained a
temporary victory. The God
given right which he claims
for the citizens of the State
of Georgia, but which is not
available to the Negro stu
dents, has worked out just
fine for the Governor.
But what about the im
pression this fiasco will make
on the fair-minded people of
Georgia and the rest of the
world, especially the propa
ganda-hungry Nikita Kru
shchev, who has publicly wel
comed the black man to the
Soviet Union? The unkind
publicity connected with this
episode is sure to be circulat
ed in such countries as Laos,
Cuba and the Congo, where
we are struggling to hold our
own. If the Governor had
taken a broader, selfless view
of the situation and had
given some consideration to
the possible repercussions,
this unfortunate incident
could have been avoided.

Contested Elections
Back here in Indiana, the
Indiana General Assembly
has filed a contest over the
election of Gov. Matthew
Welsh. Mr. Welsh has re
plied that it is an action to
deny the right of the people
of Indiana to elect their gov
ernor.
If this is true, how about
the contested seat of George
O. Chambers for the seat from
Fifth Indiana District? The
will of the people was ex
pressed in this instance and
Mr. Chambers was given
three certificates of election
—one from a Democrat Sec
retary of State whose term of
office expired on December
I—and two more certificates
from the Republican Secre
tary of State of Indiana who
took office on December 1.
Even so, the Democrat ma
jority in the House of Rep
resentatives broke precedent
and refused to seat Mr.
Chambers with any privileges.
Only after one week of
“searching for precedents”
was he even given an office.
I have seen several similar
cases while I was in Congress
and the contested member
was seated without prejudice
to either contestant and also
given the right to represent
his district until some action
was taken by the appropriate
committee in the House.
Why can not the will of
the people of the Fifth Dis
trict of Indiana speak as well
for Mr. Chambers as Mr.
Welsh insists it has spoken
for him? , , _

The picture of the Negro
girl student at the University
of Georgia who held and
kissed a statue of the Ma

religious propaganda or
what? Such pictures are
wonderful grist for Khru

How corny can you get?
The Star prints a picture of
Charlayne Hunter clutching
a statue of the Madonna,
and immediately we assume
that integration is a relig
ious war, involving the right
of a Negro Catholic to attend
school with a white Anglo-

The recent incidents at
the University of Georgia
cause me to wonder about
the intelligence and matur
ity of my fellow Americans.
I am appalled and ashamed
that members of my race
have violated not only the
civil rights of American citi
zens but their human and
moral rights as well.
Our country is founded
upon principles which insure
basic human rights which
we all understand, yet the
people of Georgia have cho
sen to deny these rights to
two members of our society
because of their color.
The violation of human
dignity involved in these in
cidents is another blot on
the record of the South.
Are we living in an era of
“might makes right” and
""mob rule” or will our citi
zens be treated according to
the great freedoms of democ
racy that we preach to the
world? How can the new
African nations respect a
country in which persons of
their race are treated so un
fairly?
The restoration of individ
ual rights cannot be simply
a matter of law, but must
have the moral support of
people.
William P. Cunningham.

It is most interesting to
note how the press pours out
sympathy to the forces of
integration and belittles and
condemns those who sin»
cerely believe in segregation.
The public is being subjected
to brain-washing, biased and
one-sided reporting.

THE POLITICAL MILL
By GOULD LINCOLN
Ike's Future Role in Politics
President Dwight D. Eisen
hower's future role in politics
and in the councils of the Re
publican Party remains to be
developed as he steps out
of the White House. Very
definitely, he leaves the presi
dential office .still a great
figure in the minds of mil
lions of his countrymen. In
his final press conference,
Mr. Eisenhower disclosed he
favors advancing the times
of presidential elections and
presidential inaugurations
which he will discuss fully at
a later date. He has reached
the conclusion, too, that the
Twenty-second amendment
to the Constitution, limiting a
President to two four-year
terms is wise. Further, he
stated that he will always be
available for consultation if
the leaders of the Republican
Party wish to confer with
him.
It seems quite clear, how
ever, that Mr. Eisenhower—
who is probably to become
Gen. Eisenhower again, re
verting to his old military
title, won as commander-in
chief of the Allied armies in
the Second World War—will
not follow in the footsteps of
his immediate predecessor,
former President Harry S.
Truman. Mr. Truman in 1956
and 1960 supported candi
dates of his own choice for his
party’s presidential nomina
tion, but without success.
Mr. Eisenhower gave his
blessing to the candidacy of
Vice President Richard M.
Nixon for the Republican
presidential nomination, but
not strongly until it was clear
no other potential candidate
was left in the field. That is,
until after Gov. Rockefeller
of New York had withdrawn
from the race. Even after the
Governor’s announcement in
December, 1959, that he would
not be a candidate, Mr. Ei
senhower continued to limit
his endorsement of Mr. Nixon
to praise of his services in
the office of Vice President
and his own personal faith
in him.
Favors Earlier Schedule
A 8 a result of his experi
ences in the presidential of
fice, Mr. Elsenhower is fa
voring the idea of earlier
presidential elections and in
augurations. If such a plan
were carried out, it would
require a constitutional
amendment. He would not
go back to the old lame
duck short sessions of Con
gress, in vogue before the
adoption of the Twentieth
amendment. But he would
give a new President at least
80 days to adjust to his new
office, to draft his messages
on the state of the Union,
his budget message, and a
legislative program, before
he was forced to face the
Congress. Mr. Eisenhower’s
point obviously is that the
present system, under which
a retiring President who does
not leave office until 17 days
after the new Congress has
assembled in Washington,
must submit his message on
the state of the Union and
a budget message during that
interval, knowing well that
Mass Transit Planning
Many visitors to Washing
ton for the inauguration will
be appalled to find that
Washington is not as clean,
beautiful, and dignified as it
used to be. They will find
that Washington rapidly is
becoming another Los An
geles. We, too, have an air
pollution problem. We, too,
are tearing down homes,
schools, and commercial
buildings to make way for
parking facilities, freeways,
and bridge approaches for the
exclusive use of pneumatic
tired vehicles. Moreover, our
principal mass transit system
is deteriorating as bumpy
smoke-belching diesel buses
replace smooth, clean, com
fortable streetcars.
The deterioration of the
Nation’s Capital will proceed
at an accelerating pace if
Congress and the Executive
Branch follow the advice of
highway and traffic engin
eers, whose mission seems to
be to perpetuate and increase
the jobs of such engineers;
who think in terms of motor
vehicles instead of human
beings; and who promote an
endless series of projects that,
instead of solving our trans
portation problems, greatly
complicate, delay, and in
crease the cost of electric
railway rapid transit con
struction and operation.
In Washington, as else
where. highway and traffic
planners are dominating
general-purpose urban and
regional planning, with the
result that mass transit, in
stead of being used to help
guide the directions of pop
ulation movement, patterns
of growth, and the character
of economic development, is
expected to serve merely as
an overflow transportation
facility, with rapid transit to
be built only as a last resort.
As evidenced by a recent
talk by Washington’s high
way and traffic director be
fore the Citizens’ Advisory
Council, many highway and
traffic engineers try to delay
rapid transit construction
and promote highway con
struction by conveniently
overlooking the disadvanta
ges of concentration on high
ways, and overlooking the
advantages of railways. Ac
tually, a good transit system
in a large metropolitan area
needs both railway and high
way transit vehicles. Those
who wish to delay rail rapid
transit construction like to
use New York City’s recent
his successor will then be
called upon to send his own
recommendations to Con
gress, as well as his own
views on the state of the
Union, contained in his in
augural address. In the
opinion of Mr. Elsenhower,
this is inefficient and in
effective procedure.
Role Up to Party
Former President Truman
has never taken himself out
of the picture in his own po
litical party, or out of poli
tics. He has disliked the
idea of being an elder states
man describing an elder
statesman as a dead politi
cian. Mr. Eisenhower de
clined flatly at his final press
conference to compare his
own future political activi
ties with those of , Mr. Tru
man. Indeed, the part Mr.
Eisenhower will play depends
in large part on what the
G. O. P. wants him to do, as
expressed by party leaders
and rank and file. He is
not expected to consider him
self titular leader of the Re
publican Party—a role that
is usually assigned to the
most recent presidential can
didate, whether he has been
successful or has lost the
election. In fact, quite the
contrary. But he will stand
ready to advise his party and
to work for it.
The outgoing President, at
his last press conference, set
himself firmly against a
repeal of the presidential two
term amendment to the Con
stitution—the Twenty-second
amendment. At first inclined
to doubt the wisdom of that
amendment, which was pro
posed by Congress and rati
fied by the necessary number
of States after conclusion of
the Franklin D. Roosevelt
regime, Mr. Eisenhower has
come to the conclusion it is
a wise provision, a tradition
violated only once since
the days of the first Presi
dent, George Washington.
Although he did not say it
In so many words, there lies
in an unrestricted number of
presidential terms an op
portunity of a self-perpetuat
ing dictatorship, a danger
that should be avoided. The
argument against the two
term amendment has been
that the American people
should be free to make use
of the services of any citizen
as Chief Executive for as
long as they desire. This
argues the indispensability of
an individual in a country of
nearly 200 million souls. The
Twenty-second amendment
does not now appear in any
danger of repeal, although a
new, youthful and vigorous
President, John F. Kennedy
of Massachusetts, is taking
over. Much will depend upon
the success of his administra
tion as to any real movement
for a return to the situation
which permitted an election
of the late President Roose
velt for a fourth term. No
war in which this country
has been involved has lasted
more than four years—and a
war today might be limited
in time to days or weeks or
months, because of the weap
ons that have been developed.
experience as typical of sub
way construction costs; they
frequently ignore the lower
costs in Washington, Boston,
Philadelphia, Toronto, and
Newark, N. J.; they Ignore
the low cost of surface rail
rapid transit; and they
understate true highway costs
by ignoring the removal of
real estate from the tax rolls,
the cost of land-acquisition
in downtown areas, and the
cost of the motor vehicles
using the highways. Mass
rapid transit costs, on the
other hand, include the cost
of the rolling stock. Highway
and traffic engineers also ig

snow and sleet storms on
autos, trucks, and buses. They
should not judge the capa
bilities of rail equipment, in
bad weather, by the perform

inadequately maintained rail
way rolling stock and tracks,
but by the performance of
streetcars and high-platform
cars in Boston, Cleveland,
Pittsburgh, New York, Phila
delphia, and many other
cities.

Pyrrhic Victory for the 'Radicals'
House Vote on the Rules Committee
Believed Auguring Trouble for Future
Twas a pyrrhic victory—
the radicals won the battle
over the plan to pack the
House Rules Committee, but
it's still a question as to who
will win the real war. For it
is mainly a war between those
who believe in sound policies
and those who advocate un*
sound policies in government.
The margin of victory—only
five votes augurs trouble
for the future. Not all those
who voted with the radicals
this time would vote for big
spending programs.
On the surface, the contro
versy over the size of the
House Rules Committee seem
ed a simple thing—the ma
jority should rule, and no
committee should be able to
prevent legislation from get
ting to the floor for a vote.
But it wasn't that simple.
Actually, the so-called cru
sade for the right of the ma
jority to rule in the House of
Representatives was just a
vehicle for pressure politics.
In the corridors of the
House brazen politics has
been played. Members who
didn't wish to vote as the
Kennedy administration
wanted 'them to vote were
told they might be punished
by losing the chance to get
appointments for their favor
ite constituents. *
There are plenty of ways,
of course, to get a bill acted
on in the House of Repre
sentatives. The rules provide
that, by signing a petition,
the majority can discharge a
committee from considering
a bill and thus get the meas
ure before the House. But
somehow it was decided by
the radicals that a lesson
should be taught Represent
ative Howard W. Smith of
Virginia, a conservative Dem
ocrat He happens to be a
man who doesn’t believe in
spending the taxpayers’
money for unnecessary pur
poses and just to get votes.
He and a number of other
Democrats, have, in effect,
formed a coalition with Re
publicans to keep the radicals
DORIS FLEESON
House Victors Not Gloating
Tough and Repeated Battles Expected
On Bi ft, With Every Vote Counting
As President Kennedy said
of his own election, the mar
gin is narrow, but the re
sponsibility is clear.
A coalition of 195 Demo
crats and 22 progressive Re
publicans has crashed the
House Rules Committee road
block against welfare legis
lation. The administration
is now obliged to offer the
legislation and try to pass it
on its merits.
No one factor produced the
winning margin of five votes
against 148 Republicans and
64 Democrats. House Speak
er Sam Rayburn's hold on
the loyalties of the flock he
had led so long, the labors
of the President’s political
aides in and out of the
White House, the President’s
own austere portrait of the
world situation—had any one
of these failed to deliver, the
battle would have been lost.
It will take time to sort out
the price paid and chart the
shifts of the past few days.
For a few agonizing moments
before the vote began. House
liberals even heard fresh talk
of new compromises.
They have won after years
RALPH McGILL
Two Approving Views of Kennedy
Briton and Frenchman at the U. N. Cite
Hopeful Factors in President's Actions
The Kennedys have hardly
had time to learn where the
White House closets and
storage rooms are, but al
ready the critical eyes are at
work.
The British are usually the
most articulate, with the
French close behind. And, at
any gathering of United Na
tions personnel both may be
heard. A couple of evalua
tions may be of interest. As
might be anticipated the
French are the more materi
al, the British more philo
sophic. (This, I know, is con
trary to the traditional view
point, but it is my experi
ence.)
“Kennedy,” said the French
representative, “did more in a
matter of hours than Eisen
hower did in years when he
ended New York’s railroad
tugmen's strike. This placed
him in direct contrast with
Mr. Eisenhower who had
made a fetish of keeping
hands off the controversies.
This was best illustrated by
the steel dispute. Also,” said
the Frenchman, “in this con
nection, I have since had a
disrespect for the American
conservative opinion which
had urged Mr. Eisenhower to
keep out but which general
ly applauded the Vice Presi
dent for moving in on the
steel strike. Mr. Nixon be
came the fulcrum on which
the issue was turned. He
could not have done it with
out White House approval.
Hence, I was made very cyni
cal to read in these same
news media that Mr. Kennedy
should have remained aloof
in the New York strike as
Mr. Eisenhower did in steel.
This is neither true nor con
sistent. Mr. Eisenhower used
Mr. N,..0n to kettle it.
“Here,” he said, ""we have
a clear example of public
interest. There must be some
from ruining the national
economy by excessive spend
ing. This coalition has oper
ated successfully for many
years to keep the so-called
liberals—who are really lib
eral to a large extent only in
the spending of, the taxpay
ers’ money from plunging
the Nation into bankruptcy.
If this coalition is actually
broken up, the Nation will
suffer, and confidence in the
value of the dollar will drop
considerably everywhere.
The Democratic political
leaders, in their desperation
to win the fight, adopted
bolder measures than ever
before. Perhaps the most
significant comment came in
a remarkable editorial Tues
day in the New York Times,
which supported the Kennedy
ticket in the last campaign.
Under the caption “Lowest
Denominator ” the editorial
said:
“As the fight over the Rules
Committee which reaches
its climax today amply
shows, President Kennedy
and his administration are
fully aware of the need to
maintain as close and favor
able a connection as possible
between the White House and
the Congress. But even the
most desperate exigencies of
the legislative situation do
not excuse the political
depths to which the new
administration subjected it
self night before last In doing
obeisance to the prospective
chairman of the House Com
mittee on Education and
Labor, Representative Adam
Clayton Powell of New York.
“Mr. Powell’s eight House
terms have been distinguished
for nothing except their un
usually high rate of absentee
ism. When he votes, he votes
on the 'liberal' side, but
despite his extravagant ora
tory, Mr. Powell has no clear
record of legislative achieve
ment; and it is recognized,
as one of his colleagues says,
that ‘he hardly ever does any
committee work.’ Yet through
of frustration. But they are
not gloating. One of their
principal spokesmen summed
it up as follows:
“The battle was bloody
every step of the way. And it
is only the beginning. Every
body should know now, in
cluding the President and his
people in the Executive
branch, that the prospect is
for one grim fight after an
other. We can bring the
issues to the floor of the
House, but we win peed every
vote we can get”
Narrow legislative divisions
place a premium on absentee
ism by those members who
are subject to conflicting
pressures. There were some
such when the rules vote was
taken, though fewer than the
Speaker had feared.
One possibility exists which
could soften the legislative
struggle.
If President Kennedy cap
tures the public Imagination,
if he manages to persuade
the American people that
their tasks are as formidable
as he himself believes, the
real steam will go out of the
conservative coalition. Its big-
20 million or more people in
the New York metropolitan
area. The city also is the
Nation’s central point of
distribution and commerce.
Something had to be done.
The Government should have
acted. But it should have
proceeded intelligently. And
it did.
""Here, if a foreigner may
say so, is the essential dif
ference between the Ken
nedy action in the New York
strike and that of the Re
publicans in steel. The Gov
ernment, in an indirect
sense, took charge in New
York. The settlement was on
the basis of h committee
whose recommendations pre
sumably will end a complex
attrition growing out of the
Industrial Revolution and
the changes thereby wrought
in old Industries. Diesels
and a loss of rail business
are involved. In steel there
was a truce. In this strike,
Mr. Kennedy’s Secretary of
Labor could act on a com
mittee which provides a pos
sibility of long-time settle
ment. In addition, it could
provide a precedent for
agreements in disputes yet to
occur. Here is a gratifying
picture of Government in
action and, more important,
a Government with a com
prehension of how to act.
This is very important.”
Here is the Britisher's
comment:
""I have reached this con
clusion about Kennedy,” he
said. “He possesses the enor
mous asset of not having to
think every day about
whether he is liked. This is
a godsend. He was elected
without being very well liked.
Mr. Nixon was even less well
liked. Neither was, or is, a
popular figure. The Ameri
can people do not yet realize
how fortunate they are in
the inexorable law of senior
ity, this Congressman who is
still under indictment for
evasion of Federal income
taxes is about to become
chairman of a major House
committee through which
some of the administration’s
most important domestic bills
will pass.
“This is of course the prin
cipal reason—but it is an in
sufficient reason—why Presi
dent Kennedy addressed to
Mr. Powell a telegram de
scribing how ‘Adam and I
have worked together and
campaigned together since
we entered Congress in 1947.’
It is, of course, the reason
—but a poor reason—why
Secretaries Ribicoff and
Goldberg, the two members
of President Kennedy’s cabi
net whose departments are
most likely to be affected by
Mr. Powell’s committee, came
up from Washington in these
hectic early days just to
honor the Powell-glorifica
tion dinner with their
presence, and to make their
hollow speeches.
“To make a hero out of
Adam Clayton Powell as did
the President and his aides
on Sunday night is to reduce
politics to the lowest com
mon denominator, an action
entirely unworthy of the
high principles and the in
spiring projects of the Ken
nedy administration.”
Everybody knows what’s
back of all this. The Negro
vote is Important to the Ken
nedy administration in the
next election—it helped im
measurably in carrying the
electoral vote of the big
States last November. The
average Negro voter doesn’t
analyze things as does the
New York Times, but is in
clined to feel that anyone
who is anti-Powel| is bad
and anyone who is pro-
Powell deserves support. This
is the thing that’s called
politics as practiced by the
so-called liberals, whose
motto in the House battle
seems to have been that “the
end justifies the means.”
(Copyright, 1861)
business backing is not what
has made the Smith-Halleck
alliapce formidable and ef
fective; it is the picture so
long painted by former Presi
dent Eisenhower of a Nation
confronting problems but do
ing on the whole extremely
well.
No voice in Congress—and
some were raised and no
political observer, whatever
his prestige, could outtalk the
victorious general who led the
World War n armies. They
protested in vain and lit their
candles in the darkness. Pres
ident Eisenhower stood firm
and insisted all was well.
Many people believe he would
still be doing so were it not
for the Twenty-second
Amendment barring'him from
a third term.
President Kennedy’s mod
erate manners after his close
election had convinced some
people that his course also
would he much more moder
ate than his campaign. His
state-of - the - Union message
went far to demolish the no
tion that somehow he wasn't
as tough as he talks. The
Rules vote amounts to a green
light tor the White House,
and the Kennedy follow
through will be equally re
vealing.
this respect. Nothing more
eroded the American Repub
lic than its obsession with its
sentimental belief that no
matter what Mr. Eisenhower
did or did not do, it must
lift up its voice in a cheer
and proclaim that it liked Ike.
This prevented any critical
examination of its own pub
lic mind and of events. Now,
it does not 'like* Kennedy in
that sense. It is watching
him with very real interest
and examination. It is pre
pared not to like him. It is
not emotionally committed to
a slogan.
""All that is to the good,
but,” continued the British
diplomat, “what is more im
portant is that already, in
these brief days, we see a
fellow at work for the coun
try. He does not have to
work for himself or his own
legend. He is not in the
Horatio Alger tradition.
Therefore, he does not need
to deal in .homespun expres
sions or epigrams out of the
copy books. He can act. Here
is a man who may be a great
one. And this, I think, the
people will learn in time.”
These are the things one
hears if one keeps an open
ear at the United Nations.
If one does not agree, one
nonetheless is stimulated.

WILLIAM S. WHITE
Moderates' Fears Unfounded
Kennedy's Program for Nation
Called Reassurin'* Thus Far
President Kennedy has
now dropped the other shoe
and in the sound of its fall
ing there is nothinr what
ever to alarm the great mod
erate political center of this
country.
Quite plainly the mod
erates’ view is to be largely
his view—so long as he and
they can keep in check the
extremists, both the ultra
liberals and the ultra-con
servatives. »
All who had feared we
might be entering an unwise
ly liberal era clamorous
with professional theories
and marked by wild spending
and hot-eyed reformism can
now put an end to their
anxieties.
They can genuinely feel
reassured—as already does
the moderate and usually
controlling center in Congress
of both parties. So, too, do
important sections of busi
ness, both big and little, as
may be seen in Wall street
and also in the private re
marks of business spokesmen.
For Mr. Kennedy’s state
of-the-Union message to
Congress, in which he laid
down his basic purposes, es
tablishes all these things:
1. A deep respect for—and
a good deal of savvy about—
the free enterprise system.
(This should not have been
too surprising; this young
President’s private fortune is
unashamedly valued by him
and he knows what system it
came from.)
2. A prudent intention to
make haste slowly—not to try
to howl a great deal of legis
lation through Congress at
the double-quick, as was done
in the national emergency of
“the first hundred days” of
the first New Deal of Frank
lin D. Roosevelt.
3. A determination to de
fend the integrity of the
American dollar in the world’s
money markets at every cost.
4. A resolution which
ironically may turn out to be
actually tougher than in the
more conservative Eisenhower
administration—to require far
greater cost-participation in
THE EVENING STAR
Waihington, D. C., Wtdntfday, Ftbruarf 1, 1961
aid programs by our foreign
friends.
5. An intention to reward
and back up good admini
strators in the Federal serv
ice to a degree not known in
our time.
6. A firm resolve to nego
tiate at the Summit with the
Soviet imperialists only when
and if some conceivable good
can come of it—and only
when and if the balance of
power lies clearly on our side
and not their’s.
True, some who are not
necessarily ultra - conserva
tives are nevertheless anxious
about some parts of the Ken
nedy program, notably an in
crease in the minimum wage,
permanent aid for areas of
chronic unemployment and
an expansipn of public-sub
sidy housing.
These plans, however, will
unfold as less far-reaching
and less costly than might at
first be supposed. Moreover,
the reasonably conservative
in and out,of Congress should
find great comfort ip one
largely overlooked Kennedy
project. This was his pledge
to give tax relief to business
men coming forward with
sound plant expansions. Al
ready, the ultra-liberals are
grumbling that this point is
altogether too “Republican”
in tone. In fact, of course, it
is simply soundly conserva
tive—neither Democratic nor
Republican in origin.
It is true, too, that

some Republican leaders are
thrusting at one or another
of the President’s economic
plans. This, too, however,
reflects no wide or real Re
publican fear. It is only their
way of keeping their hand in.
So the sum of it as of now
is this: Mr. Kennedy has
demonstrated no slightest
purpose to become the hero
of the left-wing; to put class
against class; or even to be
come a hotly partisan Pres
ident. He just wants to run
a calmly effective national
shop. He is not here to make
America over; he is here to
make some repairs, but no
revolution.

We Need Alaska Bar Representation ...
SENATOR LESTER BRONSON has introduced a
^ a bill to amend the regulations governing the
Board of Governors of the Alaska Bar Assn., giving
the Second Judicial District representation which is
only just and fair.
As the rules now stand the Second District is not
entitled to a member on the board until there are four
practicing attorneys in this part of Alaska!
The present law provides three practicing at
torneys from the Third Judicial District, three from
the First and three from the Second and Fourth com
bined.
The amendment makes it possible for one of the
two practicing lawyers in this district to be a board
member and represent Northwestern Alaska which
has needs and problems uniquely its own. This bill
will correct another of those situations where injustice
was done, although probably not intentionally.

a^'e^s nn Increase in
Uneni 'I^ ^ ent Benefits
By Norman Walker
DETROIT — Secretary of
Labor Arthur Goldberg Saturday
chartered a permanent increase
in unemployment compensation
benefits in addition to the $1.2
billion emergency idle aid plan j
'already advanced by President
Kennedy.
“We are convinced the general
level of unemployment compen
sation benefits has fallen behind
the times — it has to be upgrad
ed,” Goldberg said in a visit to
this economically hard-hit area.
The Labor Secretary conferred
with business, labor and political
leaders in a stopover on his five
state tour of unemployment areas
to drum up support for the Ken
nedy program.
Goldberg said details have yet
to be worked out on Kennedy’s
plan for permanent expansion of
the unemployment compensation
program. But he indicated federal
legislation will be sought to boost
benefits that up to now have been
fixed by the individual states.
Gov. John B. Swainson, with
whom Goldberg conferred, said
that the benefit level in Michigan
should be increased to make up
two-thirds of the worker’s regular
pay.
Michigan has a state-wide idle
rate of 11.2 per cent of the work
force.
Goldberg said that if proposals
already recommended by the
Kennedy Administration don’t re
sult in a springtime upturn in the
economy the administration will
be ready with a more far-reach
ing program. This could include
tax revisions, he said.
Gambling Law Resolution
“Ruled Out of Order”
JUNEAU UP) — Introduction of
a resolution endorsing the state’s
present gambling law was ruled
out of order Saturday by House
Speaker Warren Taylor.
The resolution had been pre
pared for introduction by Rep.
Henry Pratt of Anchorage.
Taylor said there was no need
for a resolution which endorses
a law that already is in effect.
“That would open the flood
gates to endorsement of every
law that’s in the books, and would
serve no useful purposes,” the
speaker said.
Pratt asked Taylor if it was his
intention to prevent the House
from any expression of its opin
ion and he appealed Taylor’s rul
ing.
The speaker’s ruling however,
was upheld by a voice vote of the
House.
The resolution asked that the
Legislature resolve “that the elec
ted delegates of the people of
Alaska are aware of the dangers
inherent in gambling and dedi
cate themselves to the mainte
nance of the present laws of Alas
ka prohibiting gambling.”
Pratt said later that he had re
ceived much mail on the subject
of gambling, and that he would
bring the matter up against next
week.

Kennedy Has a Two-Hour
Session with Key Advisers
On U. S. - Soviet Policy
WASHINGTON Wi — President
Kennedy talked for two hours
Saturday with a panel of key ad- |
visers on U. S.-Soviet policy. He '■
got a first-hand report from Am
bassador Llewellyn Thompson on
his recent confidential conference
with Premier Khrushchev.
It is now expected that Ken
nedy and Khrushchev probably
will meet for an informal get
acquainted session in a little more
than two months.
The President’s purpose in going
into such a get-together would be
two-fold:
1. To make an initial explora
tion at the summit level — but
not in a summit conference — of
Khrushchev’s purposes in the
present phase of his policy to- j
ward the United States; to find
out whether there are possible
East-West agreements especially
in the field of disarmament.
2. To impress upon Khrushchev
in the most emphatic manner that
the U. S. government is deeply
concerned over the persistent fail
ure of peace efforts in the Congo
and Laos. The United States re- j
gards Communist support for
rebel elements in both places as j
a major cause of trouble.
Sitting in with Kennedy and 1
the panel of ambassadors-ad
visers were Secretary of State
Rusk and Vice President Johnson.
Johnson characterized the two- j
hour session as an “informal talk""
but declined any specific infor- 1
mation about it. There was no
statement from the White House. |

PORTLAND* UP — The first

off the presses at 9 a. m. Satur
day and Portland has three daily
newspapers for the first time in
22 years.
The daily publication of the
Reporter began on the first anni
versary of its establishment as a
weekly newspaper. It has been
published semi-weekly for some
months.
It is staffed by union mem
bers on strike against the Ore
gonian and Oregon Journal, the
city’s two other dailies. That
strike began more than a year
ago.
The front page of the Reporter’s
first edition had a picture lay
out on the floods and high water
which have hit Western Oregon.
The paper is published in tab
loid form.
Publisher Robert Webb said the
Reporter’s initial circulation as a
daily exceeded 60,000.

U. S. Gold Measures Affect Canada . . .
IUST HOW ANY LITTLE NATION can be an island
"" unto itself economically could not better be il
lustrated than by the present careful fiscal maneu
vering Canada is having to do because of our trouble
with balance of payments and the drain on our gold
reserves.
Because we have an imbalance of $3.5 billion—
not on trade, but on capital movement—we think we
have troubles. But consider Canada with a $1 billion
adverse trade balance.
Also, while we have $40 billion net in foreign
assets abroad, Canada has a net external debt of
about $17 billion.
Translate both of these to our scale and it is as
though we had a $10 billion annual adverse trade
balance and $200 billion in external debt.
But because we are concerned over the drain on
our gold and our adverse balance of payments, we are
taking measures which may worsen Canada’s plight.
The “Buy American” directive, if rigidly en
forced, could result in substantial dollar losses to
Canada—who, incidentally, buys 60 per cent of her
imports from us. . . .
The consequence of this is that the new Canadian
budget revealed recently contains several proposals
designated to make investment of American capital
in Canada less attractive. . . .
In no sense is this “retaliation” on Canada’s part.
It is simply that our two nations are in the same econ
omic boat, when we start rocking same, Canada has
to take offsetting action.
This is an important factor for the new Adminis
tration to keep in mind when it tackles the problem
of our balance of payments. We don’t want to hurt
our best customer and staunchest international friend
in the process of getting our own books squared away.

Defence Spending
May Exceed
Korean War Peak
WASHINGTON !/P — The de
fense budget, as revised by the
Kennedy Administration for the
next fiscal year, may approach or
exceed the peak spending in the
Korean War.
The estimate for the year start
ing next July 1, as submitted to
Congress by the Eisenhower Ad
ministration, was $42.9 billion.
Specualtion is that additions to
this may range up to $2 billion.
Such a boost would top the $43.7
billion military budget in fiscal
1953, peak spending year of the
Korean War.
At the Pentagon, Secretary of
Defense Robert S. McNamara and
his aides are working up a new
study of strategy as directed by
President Kennedy. Until that is
completed — by the end of this
month — and turned over to the
President and his budget makers,
no firm estimate of the revised
military budget can be made.
However, some preliminary
moves, made in response to Ken
nedy’s request for accelerated ac
tion in defense programs, obvi
ously will cost more money which
presumably would appear in the
revised fiscal 1962 bill.
First of these items is addition
of 55 jet and propjet transport
planes for troop and cargo air
lift.
Responding to the President’s
request, the Pentagon — like other
federal departments — is trying
to eliminate spending for items or
organizations that have become
obsolete.
But the constantly mounting re
quirements of defense virtually
assure that an increase in military
spending is in prospect.
These requirements arise out
of the unrelenting arms race with
the Communist powers and swift
strides made in weapon technol
ogy. The demands have confront
ed both Democratic and Republi
can Administrations since World
War II.
In the nearly 16 years since that
global conflict — including three
years of Korean War—the United
States has spent more than half
a trillion dollars on defense.
How Much Docs
Your Family Spend —
n 1 For What?
NEW YORK — How much
| docs your family spend — and
1 for what?
The government wants to know.
So it’s going to revise the
makeup of the cost of living in
dex last updated in 1950.
A lot of things — tranquilizers,
j for instance — have become note
i worthy items in the American
I economy since then.
And changing times have raised
many other questions, such as
whether the price of hamburger
should figure in the compilation.
The latest monthly index issued
by the government was last De
cember’s 127.5 — meaning that
prices of items listed were 27.5
per cent over what they were in
the 1947-1949 period, which is
the 100 base.
The Labor Department plans a
comprehensive survey of con
sumer spending habits because it
believes the reporting value of
some of the hundreds of items that
figure in the index may be out
moded.
The survey will start in the
New York metropolitan area.
The plans were announced by
Ewan Clague, Commissioner of
; Labor Statistics in the Depart
ment of Labor. Labor Department
j statisticians will be sent out to
j question families who have in
i comes from wages.
The government announced
some time ago that it would con
duct the survey in 27 cities this
year and 27 next year, and in 12
metropolitan areas both years.
The families — selected at ran
dom for the survey — will be
asked to give details on all their
living expenses in 1960.

Wcuid Modify Election
; Code’s Provisions on
IS raighl Parry Voting
JUNEAU l/P> — A bill which
would modify the stale election
' code’s provisions on straight party
voting was introduced in the
House at the request of Gov.
Egan.
The proposed statute changes
the straight party provisions in
three ways.
First, it would permit candi
dates whose names are marked
individually, noth withstanding a
straight party vote in the other
column, to receive the vote in
tended for him.
The second amendment deals
with situations where two or more
candidates are to be elected to
the same office, such as in elec
tion districts which send two or
more members to the State House
of Representatives.
The amendment would provide
that when a voter marks the
straight party square and also
marks the name of a candidate
of a different party, only this in
dividual vote would be counted.
The proposed statute also pro
vides that when a voter marks
more than one straight party
square these marks will be dis
regarded and only those marks
placed beside the names of in
j dividual candidates will be count

ers engaged in private prac
tice. Most of these are in the
family and marital counseling
fields. Hans Klagsbrunn, act
ing chairman of the HWC
board, said that many of these
individuals are untrained and
incompetent.
Reading from a written
opinion, William B. Jones, gen
eral counsel of the HWC. said
“obviously this report has for
its commendatory purpose the
raising of standards in the
field of private family counsel
ing and the making available
to those in the need of such
counseling family counselors
possessing at least the mini
mum standards of professional
competency.”
Crossed Off
The attorney went on to say
that should some persons en
gaged in social work be deemed
unsuitable by the HWC, they
would not appear on the ap
proved list. Also, Mr. Jones
said, those who, after being
placed on the list, failed to
continue to comply with the
standards would have their
names removed from the list.
Although the standards of
the HWC would have no legal
bearing on private social work
ers, Mr. Jones said, “such per
sons as HWC fconsidered un
worthy of listing or of being
retained on the list would be
expected to suffer a loss in
their clientele and thus be ad-
versely affected In the income
producing activities of their
calling.”
Mr. Jones also pointed out
that the District of Columbia,
Maryland and Virginia, the
three jurisdictions in which
HWC operates, no legislation
now exists to outline minimum
standards for social work in
private practices.
The board of directors then
voted to go ahead with the
study after the language in
two paragraphs of the proposal
had been amended. The first
amendment dealt with the pur
pose of the proposal. The lan
guage “of establishing mini
mum standards” was changed
to “study appropriate stand
ards.”
The second amendment stip
ulated that the results of the
study not be released (to the
press), but would be reported
to the HWC board of directors
only.

montgomery county sentinel.,"['Gaithersburg', 'Rockville']",1961-03-09,"The last 30 days of a 90-day
session are horrible. It has al
ways been that way and prob
ably always will be. I doubt
that it would be any better if
our sessions were nine months
long. Witness the inevitable
accumulations near the end of
a session of Congress.
In any event, we have now’
reached the stage where it is
almost impossible to answer
our mail, to return telephone
calls, or to accommodate the
folks who want to come and
have a chat with the delega
tion.
So I think I will kill two
birds with one stone by an
swering some communications
through this column. Other
readers may be interested in
the same subjects:
Ripper Bill
To the Springbrook High
School P-TA—You can stop
worrying about H. B. 432,
known as the ripper bill,
which would have made cer
tain department heads (includ
ing the State Superintendent
of Schools) serve at the pleas
ure of the Governor. It was
summarily killed by the Ways
and Means Committee on the
very day of its arrival.
To the people who have
written in about the “pistol
bills”—These bills probably
will not be enacted, but I still
think they have some merit.
Plfease be assured that we do
not wish to violate the Second
Amendment (the right of a
citizen to bear arms) and that
we are not taking orders from
the Kremlin.
The bills simply provide for
a waiting period between or
dering a pistol and actually
getting it, during which period
a search of police records
could be concluded. It would
also serve as a cooling-off pe
riod. Alger Barbee calls atten
tion to the fact that the three
most recent violent deaths in
the county (two homicides and
a suicide) have bene commit
ted with guns bought the very
same day.

Answering 4 lnside Annapolis’
Dear Blair:
It Is gratifying to note in
your column on land taxation
last week that you recognize
some of the abuses that have
arisen under your Farm Land
Assessment Acts. However, the
amendment proposed by you to
Senator Northrop goes only a
little ways toward cutting down
on the present million dollar
tax give-away to large land
owners, and does nothing at all
to help preserve “open spaces”
in the County. In fact, it will
eliminate the very tax benefit
which you have claimed would
preserve “open spaces” in the
close-in areas where we need
open spaces the most.
The people of this County
want to preserve for themselves
and for their children some of
our green countryside now
■rapidly being swallowed by
urban development. It was “to
preserve open spaces” that we
passed Questions 13 and 14 on
constitutional amendments at
the last election.
Your Farm Land Assessment
Act, House Bill 391, now pend
ing in the Senate, will continue
to cost us a million dollars a
year in taxes and actually will
work against preserving open
spaces. It needs amendment
for three good reasons:
FIRST. The Cost: Your
“Committee for Open Spaces,”
which campaigned for Questions
13 and 14 last fall, said your
law reduces the county’s tax

Inside Annapolis
By BLAIR LEE, 111
Chairman, Montgomery County Delegation
about to get embroiled in an
alcoholic-beverages-for- restau
rants bill in the dying days of
this session. Where were your
members L.st November when
we were holding public hear
ings and calling for legislative
proposals?
To Dean Donald Deyo of
Montgomery Junior College—
Thanks for your letter approv
ing S. B. 211 (the James-Lee
community college bill), which
has now passed both houses
and awaits the Governor’s sig
nature. It puts a firm legal
foundation under our growing
two-year college system and
provides for continuing State
aid. In my opinion it is the
most important piece of legis
lation that has passed so far
this year.
To Darius V. Phillips and
the Committee for Fair Taxa
tion—What goes on? When
H. B. 391 (the re enactment of
the farm land assessment
law) was in the House, you
asked for a hearing before the
Delegation, and we arranged
it. Then you cancelled it. Now,
with the bill long since gone
to the Senate, you ask for an
other Delegation hearing.
Please address yourself to the
Senate, where the bill is.
To Jesse Nicholson—Your
Park and Planning Commis
sion legislative program is un
believably dull this year.
Most of it is moving forward
quietly. The Civic Federation
supported your request for a
3-cent park tax increase (sub
ject to approval by the County
Council), while the Allied
Civic Group favored a 1-cent
increase. We split the differ
ence at 2 cents, and the bill
has gone to the Senate.
Mandatory Dedication
To A1 Carter and Jack Neu
mann—Thanks for your help
in working out H. B. 351 so
that it has teeth rather than
fangs. It will confirm the
county’s right to require dedi
cation of streets and play
grounds in all new subdivi
sions and to require dedication
for other public uses (such as
school sites) in subdivisions
in average lot size zoning or in
planned communities. Thanks
to A1 McArthur of the Nation
al Association of County Of-
base by only four-tenths of one
percent. That would be about
$5 million. Our studies, based
on the Census of Agriculture
and on the tax records, esti
mate the loss to be about S4O
million. That means a loss in
taxes close to a million dollar’s
a year, $lO a year for each
average home-owner compared
to your estimate of less than 50
cents. That isn’t chicken feed.
SECOND. We do not get
Open Spaces for our money.
The landowner gets a whopping
reduction in his real estate
taxes, and can still develop his
land whenever he wishes. Then
we have nothing to show for
the tax money we have lost.

PORTLAND CEMENT ASSOCIATION sl2 Kaytar •IISin f , Salllmart 2, Maryland
A national organization to improve and extend the uses of concrete
ficials for a very heulful brief
of legal precedents in this
field. The bill has passed the
House.
To Messrs. Overhold, Ing
berg et al.—Don’t count on the
passage of H. B. 222, which
would allow an exemption of
SI2OO of retirement income in
computing the State income
tax. My guess is that the di
rector of the Income Tax Di
vision will succeed in knocking
it off once again.
Please note, however, that
the House has passed our bill
to liberalize the Montgomery
County property tax exemp
tion law for the homesteads of
persons over 65 (and also to
tighten up some loopholes).
The new provisions will allow
an exemption of $3,600 for
persons whose gross income is
under $3,600. The figures are
$3,000 and $3,000 in the pres
en law.
To the gentleman who
wrote in suggesting that the
American Automobile Associa
tion would oppose the
Schweinhaut-Lee resolution
calling for an official study of
which method of automobile
inspection (private garages or
State-owned garages) would
be most suitable to Maryland
—You are quite mistaken, sir.
The resolution was drafted by
the AAA and was handed to
Peggy and me by Washington
Irving Cleveland.
Land Reserve
To Dave Cahoon—Grahame
Walker and I may yet intro
duce that bill that we have
been fussing with for several
months. It would create a
Montgomery County Land Re
serve Agency, effective upon
the appointment of its mem
bers by the County Council.
Armed with bond issue money,
it would buy land at acreage
prices and hold it for later
sale at the same price, plus in
terest, to agencies that need
it, such as the State Roads
Commission.
Since the Planning Commis
sion has never shown any in
terest in its revolving fund,
some other agency had better
step into the breach. Operated
intelligently, it could produce
a tremendous long-range sav
ing of tax money.
Our county is going to keep
on developing as long as people,
stores and industry want to
move in. Your bill will not re
tard development. It subsidizes
farmers and speculators who
are holding land for develop
ment, making it easy for them
to hold land off the market
while waiting for the price to
go up. The increase in price is
passed on to the people who buy
homes or go into business and
to the taxpayers who will have
to buy school sites, highway
right-of-way and park land at
inflated prices.

PROCLAMATION Governor J. Millard
Tawes, right, is showing the proclamation
declaring the week of March 12 as Pythian
Week. The ceremony took place in the
Governor’s office in Annapolis. Shown with
him left to right are: Charles H. Ross, Grand
Chancellor: Brawner Z. Harding of Gaith
ly prevent us from preserving
open spaces by nullifying last
year’s law authorizing the coun
ty to buy the development
rights for land. That is a good
law, but it will become practi
cally a dead letter if your House
Bill No. 391 is passed.
You gave the reason in last
week’s column. In your own
words: “No county government,
no matter how much it may
want to preserve open spaces,
has the money to buy the de
velopment rights of more than
a tiny fraction of the hundreds
of square miles of farm land
within its boundaries.” The
county probably couldn’t afford
to buy the development rights
for more than a few hundred
acres a year. At that rate, be
fore long, the whole county will
be covered with urbran sprawl
and we shall see very few green,
open spaces permanently pre
served for our enjoyment and
that of our children.
Therefore, the County needs
to get land-owners to donate
development rights or to sell
them at moderate prices. How?
By offering the land-owner a
tax reduction in exchange for
agreement not to develop his
land. Farmers who really want
to keep on farming would be
glad to make this exchange.
Country clubs, golf courses,
community swimming pools,
and other holders of open land
might do the same thing.
But your Bill 391 would take
away the incentive for land
owners to make such agree
ments to keep their land open
because it just hands the land
owners big tax reductions on a
silver platter without any bene
fit being given back to the coun
ty-
Amendments 13 and 14 were
sold to the voters at the last
election on the basis that any
laws enacted under them would
preserve open spaces and “Save
Our Countryside.” Since you
and Senator Northrop, and Mrs.
Cook and Mr. Woodward, were
leaders in this campaign of the
Montgomery County Committee
for Open Spaces, we call upon
ersburg, Supreme Representative; Ira Whit
tington, Grand Prelate; Edward M. Akers,
Past Supreme Representative. The Order
Knights of Pythian was founded February
19, 1864 in Washington, D. C. and was the
first Fraternal Order to be chartered by a
special act of the United States Congress.
you to keep faith with the vot
ers and to amend your bill 391
to help preserve open spaces.
Issues so vitally affecting the
future of our County should
be brought out into the open at
public hearings on amendments
before the Senate votes on this
bill. For this reason we wired
Senator Northrop and yourself
urgently requesting public hear
ings before his Senate commit
tee and before the Montgomery
County Delegation.
The Citizens Committee for
Fair Taxation urges amend
ments to provide that land in
Montgomery County will only
get reduced assessments below
full value if the development
rights are conveyed to a public
agency. Country clubs, golf
courses, community swimming
pools, and other appropriate
open land uses should be given
the same opportunity to have
their taxes reduced if they
agree to keep their lands in
open use. If the representa
tives of other counties should
desire different provisions for
their counties, the bill should be
amended to apply at least to
Montgomery County. It often
has been the practice in Mary
land to enact different provi
sions for different counties, for
example, the assessment of busi
ness inventories is made on a
different basis in different coun
ties.
Montgomery County then will
be able to undertake a program
for the permanent preservation
of open spaces by acquiring de
velopment rights and buying ad
ditional park lands with the tax
money we will recover from the
landowners who are unwilling
to sell development rights, and
who will again pay taxes on the
full value of their property just
as all the rest of us are required
to do,
Yours for a better Montgom
ery County with more green,

62nd Year No. 30 NOME, ALASKA, MONDAY, MARCH 13, 1961 Per Copy 15*
Nuns Molested by
Congolese Troops
By Dennis Neeld
LEOPOLDVILLE — Nuns
have been stripped and one
American missionary girl has
raped by Congolese soldiers on
the rampage in the rebel province
of Kivu, the United Nations re
ported today.
U. N. Malayan patrols are push
ing out from Kindu, trying to
reach isolated villages where
whites are at the mercy of the
Congolese soldiers.
A nun reaching Kindu from a
mission station at Kasongo told of
48 hours of terror, rape and bes
tiality soon after the death of
ex-premier Patrice Lumumba last
month. The nun, said nine sisters
from the mission were bundled
into trucks and carted off to the
local jail.
A 75-year-old nun said she was
thrown out of the truck and her
arms broken and her shoulder
dislocated. That nun has now
reached Leopoldville.
In a prison courtyard, the nuns
were made to dance barefoot on
stones and gravel, singing hymns
to Lumumba. Then they were
made to lie on the ground and
strip off their clothes.
“They did not rape us but they
did things so disgusting to our
poor bodies that we dare not speak
of them, much less write of
them,” one nun said.
White residents in small com
munities around Kindu live in
nightly terror of being ordered
from their beds at bayonet point
and made to parade naked before
jeering Congolese.
In those communities Congo
lese soldiers break into houses at
any time and help themselves to
food, money and jewelry.
WTien the whites protest they
are left with nothing to eat, the
soldiers reply “you can eat man
ioc like we do.” Manioc is a
primative vegetable food.
Patterson Meets Johansson
Tonight for Title Defense
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. UP) —
Heavyweight champion Floyd Pat
terson today weighed 194%
pounds — the heaviest of his
career — for his title defense
against Ingemar Johansson of
Sweden at Convention Hall to
night.
Johansson weighed 206V&. It
also was Johansson’s top weight.
The new Yorker weighed 182
to Johansson’s 196 for their first
fight in New York, June 26, 1959,
when the Swede knocked out Pat
terson.
In their return bout at New
York last June 20, Patterson
weighed 190, his heaviest to that
date, when he knocked out Inge
mar, who then weighed 194%.
There will be a radio broad
cast fAPC) of the 15-rounder,
but there will be no home tele
vision.
Causes Big Scramble
For Governorship
SACRAMENTO, Calif. UP) —
Former Vice President Richard
M. Nixon invited a scramble for
the Republican nomination for
governor next year when he said
over the weekend:
“I am not a candidate for gov
ernor. I have no intention to be
be a candidate or institute a
draft.”
In private conversations Friday
and Saturday, Nixon declined to
say he wouldn’t except nomina
tion and wouldn’t serve it elected.
Four of Five Bonding
Proposals Slide Through
Without Amendment
JUNEAU (#> — Four of the five
general obligation proposals ap
proved by the voters last fall
slipped through second reading in
the House without amendment to
day.
Republicans, picking up sup
port from Democratic Rep. Bob
Blodgett, voted against moving
the measures up from second read
ing to final passage.
On the fourth bill, the Demo
crats, realizing they couldn’t
muster the two-thirds majority to
advance' the bill, didn’t even at
tempt to move it up.
When the House got to the fifth
general obligation proposal on
the calendar, the $23 million
Ferry Bond Proposal, it recessed
until 2 p. m.
When the bill came up on sec
ond reading, Rep. Bennie Leonard,
who had recommended that the
bill “do pass” when it came out of
the State Affairs Committee,
asked that his recommendation
be changed to “do not pass in its
present form.”
The first four general obligation
bonding proposals to hit the cal
endar, in order, would provide
$2.5 for obtaining federal Hill
Burton matching funds for hospi
tal construction and equipment;
$1.5 for construction of a Voca
tional Education School north of
the Yukon River; $1.5 million for
constructing and equipping bush
airfields; and $2 million for con
struction of a new gymnasium
and improvements to the water
system at the University of Alas
ka.
Bills Okayed by Senate
JUNEAU UP) —Legislation which
would eliminate the requirement
that cars carry two license plates
was approved by the Senate Sat
urday. Only one license plate
would be carried on the rear of
each vehicle.
The sponsor of the measure,
Sen. Paul Greimann said the bill
would result in an annual saving
of some $9,000-$10,000.
The Senate gave its approval
Saturday to a bill which would
levy a 5 per cent tax on the gross
receipts of professional and semi
professional athletic and sport
ing events.
One of the sponsors of the meas
ure, Sen. A1 Owen said the tax
levy would bring in some $700,
000 a year.
Most state employers would be
required to hire workers from
areas which the Commissioner of
Labor has designated as areas of
labor surplus under the provisions
of a bill was okayed by the Sen
ate Saturday.
Senate Kills Jury Trials
In Municipal Cases
JUNEAU iff) — A bill which
would have permitted the de
fendants in cases involving vio
lations of municipal ordinances
to ask for a jury trial was killed
in the Senate Saturday.
NO WORD FROM SOVIET
VENUSNIK SINCE FEB. 27
MOSCOW (#* — No one knows
where the Soviet Venus rocket
is or whether contact will be
established with it again.
The Venusnik blasted of Feb.
12, then disappeared Feb. 27.
Tass, the Soviet news agency,
had said that the scientists would
! try to re-establish radio contact
There has been no word that they
have made any progress.
II. S. Soldier of
Fortune Executed
By Castro’s Militia
HAVANA UP) — William A.
Morgan, American soldier of for
tune who fell from national hero
to traitor in the eyes of the Fidel
Castro regime, was buried Sun
day in a crypt beside the Cuban
major executed with him.
Friends of Morgan’s Cuban wife
attended the rites in Colon ceme
tery, and a Catholic priest offi
ciated. Mrs. Morgan, in hiding to
escape captivity, did not attend
the funeral. She and 10 others
were convicted of treason along
with her husband last week, and
she was declared a fugitive.
The five-man court at La Ca
bana Fortress sentenced Morgan
and Maj. Jesus Carreras to die
Saturday after convicting them
of aiding anti-Castro rebels in
the mountains. A firing squad
shot them in a dry moat ouside the
ancient fortress a few hours later.
Morgan, 52, of Toledo, Ohio,
got a dishonorable discharge
from a U. S. paratrooper unit in
Japan and in 1957 joined Castro’s
revolution and after the over
throw of Dictator Fulgencio Ba
tista stayed in Cuba.
Two years later he lost his
American citizenship for fighting
in a foreign army. But at the
time he was enjoying a hero’s
stature for helping to decoy a
group of anti-Castro plotters into
a trap.
Later he was demoted to run
ning a government frog farm. He
told newsmen last fall that he
was a staunch anti-Communist
and didn’t know how long he
would last in his job.
Senate Kills Bill to
Move Key Sections of
Division of Highways
JUNEAU UP — The Senate to
day killed a bill which would
have required several key sec
tions of the State Division of
Highways to be relocated in West
ward Alaska by next Sept. 1.
The vote on the bill was 11-9 i
to indefinitely postpone action on 1
the measure, a move that has the
effect of killing it.
When the bill was first intro
duced, it called for relocation of
Highway Division’s Administra
tive Headquarters at a point north
and west of Yakutat.
The bill was amended, how
ever, to require only that the
right of way, engineering, plan
ning and design sections be
moved, with administrative head
quarters to remain in Juneau.
Sec. of Commerce
Hodges Says Recession
“Has Hit Bottom”
WASHINGTON UP — Secretary
of Commerce Luther H. Hodges
says it will not be necessary to
cut taxes this spring to spur the
economy.
Hodges said Sunday he thinks
the recession has hit bottom and
the economy now can start up
ward.
President Kennedy said in Jan
uary that he would take another
look at the state economy in April.
A temporary tax cut might then
be considered, he said, if the econ
omy is still lagging.
“Generally speaking I think
there’s a better spirit and a gen
eral feeling that things are going
to get better soon,” Hodges said
in a TV-radio interview.
Blodgett Charges “Skulduggery”
In Ferry-Road Bonding Issue
By Ward Sims
Associated Press Staff Writer
JUNEAU UP) — The huge $23
million Ferry-Road Bonding Bill
hit the floor of the House of
Representatives for amendment j
today, as a storm of accusations j
swirled around the controversial
measure.
Rep. Bob Blodgett told the As
sociated Press the bonding propo
sition “from its very inception j
has been saddled with premedi- !
tated skulduggery.”
In a long statement, Blodgett
accused Gov. Egan and the 1961
Legislature of attempting to sub
vert the will of the people in
implementing voter approval of
the issuance of $23 million worth
of general obligation bonds for
ferries and roads.
Blodgett said the 1960 Legis
lature, in submitting the bonding
proposal to the voters, intended
that $5 million of the $23 million
be used for construction of the
proposed Fairbanks-Nome Road, j
Now, Blodgett said, the adminis- ,
tration wants to use the $5 mil
lion for maintenance and road
relocation.
“They’re running this show as
they damned well please and the
people down here in the Legis- i
lature are apparently nothing but
a bunch of rubber stamps,” Blod
gett said.
Blodgett Stormed Out of Caucus
Blodgett, asked why he stormed
out of a Democratic caucus last
Thursday afternoon, said:
“I refuse to have people tell
me in a caucus, ‘if you don’t vote
for House Bill 44, you won’t get
your Vocational School at Nome.’
“Well, that’s a pretty doggoned
rotten way of doing business. Now,
talk about a bunch of hatchet
men, we’ve got them. People that
have been friends of mine right
here in Alaska for years came
right out and made that state
ment to me in caucus.
“If it follows that Northwestern
Alaska doesn’t come into its own
just due in this road bonding pro
gram, if we don’t get Route 97
from Fairbanks to Nome, I can
assure the people of the state and
our illustrious administration that
I will work in the future for the
defeat of any bonding proposi- j
tions.
“I think it would be wrong to
ask the people of my area to vote
for the passage of any future1
bonding proposition if we are to
be sold down the river now.”
House Speaker Warren Taylor
denied that Blodgett was threat
ened in the Democratic party
caucus.
Rep. Morgan Reed, Chairman
Metlakatla and Pelersburgh
Win Basketball Tournaments
JUNEAU (JP) — Metlakatla and
Petersburg won the Class AA
and Class A Divisions, respective
ly, of the Gold Medal Basketball
Tournament Saturday night.
Metlakatla rolled over a strong
Sitka ANB team, 52-41. It was
the first loss for the Sitka squad.
Alaska's Population Increases
253.1 Per Cent in 60 Years
WASHINGTON (JP) — The Cen
sus Bureau says Alaska’s popula
tion increased 253.1 per cent in
the 60 years between 1900 and
last year. The 1900 population i
: was given as 64,000. Last year as
I 226,000, an increase of 162,000.
of the House State Affairs Com
mittee, said:
“If there was any premeditated
skulduggery connected with any
of the bonding propositions, Blod
gett had as much to do with it as
anyone because he was a mem
ber of the Finance Committee
which drafted them.
“The governor has taken a
hands-off attitude regarding the
implementation of the bond issues.
The Fairbanks-Nome Road with
which Blodgett is so much con
cerned is not even a road system
that would entitle it to matching
funds.”
Egan said he had recommended
against using the $5 million for
road construction at this time be
cause the state had already com
mitted its federal highway aid
matching funds.
“Why should we spend this $5
million now and get 7-10 miles of
road out of it, when we can wait
and get some $60-$70 million in
federal matching funds later?”
Egan asked.
McNees and Hopson Comment
Two senators from the North
western District, John McNees
and Eben Hopson commented in
a joint statement:
“Much has already been said,
some of it wrongly so, as to the
position of the Northwestern leg
islators on the various bonding
measures under the considera
tion by the Legislature.
“Much pressure has been placed
on us from a wide variety of
sources and in many ways —
threats have frequently been
made, both by proponents of the
bonding program as well as the
opponents.
“The reason that the ‘ice bloc'
has been singled out for pressure
is that it very likely holds the
hinge vote in either or both
Houses of the Legislature on
many of the issues involved.
Furthermore, we intend to take
advantage of that position to see
that the intent of the 1960 Legis
lature and the Joint Finance
Committees of that session is car
ried out. That, and no more than
that, is our position.”
McNees and Hopson said the
intent was that the $5 million be
spent, along with federal match
ing monies on a 19-1 ratio, for con
struction of the Fairbanks-Nome
Road.
“We arc morally certain,” they
said, “that this was the intent of
the Joint Finance Committee, the
1960 Legislature and all of the
people of Alaska in voting for it.
“We feel our claim is a just, a
moral and a legal one, and we
are disappointed that we are not
getting the full backing of the
administration in carrying it out.”
Anchorage Area Cut Out
Rep. Bennie Leonard of An
chorage, asked to comment on
Blodgett’s statement, said:
“If Mr. Blodgett feels that
Northwestern Alaska might be
cut out of the bonding issues, I
ask him to look at the Anchor
age area, where 42 per cent of
the state taxes originate, and see
how that area has fared in this
road program, or any of the other
bonding issues.
“It saddens us all to see the
Vocational School being vote
traded to Nome for the Ferry
Bond issue. This is another case
of legislation by the Democratic
oarty caucus.”",oldest newspaper alaska member associated press year nome alaska monday march copy nun molest congolese troop dennis neeld leopoldville nuns strip american missionary girl rape

Put Under One Chief
By tbe Associated Press
The Defense Department re
shuffled the Air Force’s re
search and procurement organ
izations today to create a new
over-all ""Air Force Systems
Command"" for centralizing di
rection of ballistic missile pro
grams.
Lt. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever,
the Air Force ballistic missile
expert and now chief of the
Air Research and Development
Command, will head the new
combined organization. The
changeover is to be completed
by July 1.
The present Air Materiel
Command, which procures
equipment, is renamed the Air
Logistics Command under the
reorganization plan.
The formal announcement
said the new Air Force Sys
tems Command is ""designed to
centralize direction of the bal
listic missiles programs and to
insure the most effective dis
charge of military space re
sponsibilities assigned to the
Air Force.”
An order by Secretary of De
fense McNamara last week as
signed almost complete control
of all space development proj
ects of the military to the Air
Force.

which swept the country in 1950
and 1951.
The old scandal affected close
to 100 persons in all. including
more than 30 players from seven
colleges. Such ranking teams
as City College of New York,
the national champion, in 1950;
Kentucky’s Olympic squad and
Bradley were caught in the web.
Several of the players, as
well as gamblers, drew jail sen
tences. Many were barred from
the game.
Arraigned before Magistrate
Mitchell J. Sherwin in Felony
Court. Wagman was held with
out bail and Hacken in $25,000
Their cases were adjourned
until March 29.
Wagman, according to the
district attorney’s office, gave a
detective attached to the dis
trict attorney’s office $lOO and
offered him a piece of the
game.
The district attorney’s office
said Wagman is the same mar
who was arrested in Gaines
ville, Fla., last September ir
connection with an attempt t<
fix a football game betweer
Florida and Florida State.
A Florida fullback, Jen Mac-
Beth, was offered $1,500 t<
hold down the score. He re
ported it immediately to au
thorities. Both Wagman and s
Florida student were arrested
Florida won the game, 3-0
Wagman was convicted but
appealed the verdict. The stu
dent was expelled.

publicans joined 39 Democrats c
to give the administration its t
5 victory by a margin of two votes.
? It was the first showdown be- J

! erals in the Senate since Presi-; <

5 The emergency unemploy- J
5 ment bill, which probably will *
- reach the President in a few :
days, was the fifth major bill '
- to go through the Senate this 1
i year.
It will enable the Federal (
f Government to begin immedi-
ately advancing to the States -
I enough money to pay extended
> unemployment benefits to idle
s workers for not more than 13
i additional weeks if they have
. exhausted their regular bene- <
- fits. c
Informed sources said today'
the House undoubtedly will to-j
sist Monday on sending the bill
to a conference committee in
the hope of eliminating the one
important change adopted in
the Senate last night.
That was the pay-as-you-go
amendment of Senator John J
Williams, Republican of Dela
ware, which made the tax in
crease apply to 1961 and 1962.;
The House voted originally to
postpone the tax hike until 1962
and 1963 in the hope business
conditions will be better then. !
It was learned today that in
fluential House members agree
with the administration it would
be a mistake to apply the tax
to 1961, which would make it
retroactive for three months.
No difficulty is expected in
reaching an agreement between
the two Houses on the second
Williams amendment to reduce
unemployment compensation of
retired persons who also are
receiving pensions.
The Senate' also passed last
night a companion bill already
approved by the House author
izing the Treasury to advance
about $24 million to pay addi
tional benefits to an estimated
60,000 idle railroad workers, to
be paid back by an increase to
the tax on railroads for un
employment compensation.
To reimburse the Federal
Governmrnt for the emergency
benefits to other workers, the;
main bill increases the unem- j
ployment compensation tax
paid by employers from 3.1 to
3.5 per cent for a period of two
years.
Excess Revenue
In 40 of the States this ad
ditional tax will produce more
revenue than will go back into
those States as payments to the
unemployed. In the other 10
States, where the unemploy
ment load is heavy, the new
tax will not be sufficient to pay
the unemployed.
But in view of the admin
istration’s Senate victory, the
new revenue will be pooled as
a national fund to meet the
costs of the payments wherever
they are made.
If the Finance Committee
view had prevailed, the 40
States with surplus tax collec
tions would have been credited
with those surpluses, which
might have permitted reduc
tions later on. The 10 deficit
States would have been re
quired to levy higher taxes on
their employers starting in
1964 to make up their differ
ence.
Senator Albert Gore, Demo
crat of Tennessee, led the suc
cessful fight to treat the prob
lem and the tax collections on
a Nation-wide basis. He was
joined by Senator Douglas,
Democrat of Illinois. But there
were indications that the
White House threw its full
weight into the fight to turn
the tide.
REPUBLICANS
Continued From First Pare
difference between victory and
defeat.
The task force is assigned
[to find organization techniques
. that will enable Republicans to
cut down the heavy Democratic
majority that furnished Ken
nedy’s winning margin in 1960.
i Chairman Morton told re
: porters today, “I hope the com-
I mittee will have a report for us
. by this summer . . . We do not
[necessarily need to carry these
I big cities—we need only to im
i: prove the Republican percent
age to win crucial States in
; [ State-wide contests.”
I As indications of the fact
i that “the G. O. P. means busi-
Jness,” Senator Morton noted ■
; that the chancellor of Temple
University, Dr. Robert L. John
son, and a vice president of
Sears Roebuck Co., James
Worthy, have resigned from
their jobs to work full time on
building Republican organiza-l
tions in Philadelphia and Chi
( cage, respectively.
In the ""memo, Mr. Morhouse
argued that the voting pattern
in 1960 made it indisputedly
clear “that we lost because we
failed to carry States where;
the outcome is dominated by
voters of the larger cities.” He
attacked Senator Goldwater’s
statement and said that Re
i publicans would “abdicate our
interest, our responsibilities,
and our right for support in
the larger cities,” if they fol- [
. lowed the Senator’s advice.
Mr. Morhouse said. “We must
establish effective Republican
I organizational apparatus on a
block -by - block, precinct-by
precinct basis, around the’
J clock, and around the cal
endar.
“Secondly, and even more im
portant, I believe, to increase
our appeal in the larger cities
we must be a soundly progres
i sive political party and our
active interest and positive ac-
I tion for the well-being of the
people . . . must be readily
’ recognizable.”
■ He took a back-hand swipe'
at Mr. Nixon's campaign strat-
. I egy by pointing out “that de-1
>; spite our nominee's fine per
; sonal record on civil rights.
> his political strategists would
• not schedule him to visit Har

TWENTY-SEVENTH YEAR, NO.
Key CM Scene ef Shoetlngt
Angered Berserk Man
Shot By Proprietor As
He Threatens With Gun
Two night club customers were shot early Friday night,
April 14, in Minneapolis when the proprietor of the place in an
effort to stop a gun waring patron from shooting club bouncers,
who had previously ejected him, shot one man and a stray bullet
struck the other. The shooting oceured near closing time.
The man whom club employes and patrons said came back
in the club waving a gun, shouting profane epithets and threat
ening to kill the employes who
ejected him is Richard Hockett,
30. 3566 Portland Ave.
Hockett wu shot when he t ailed
to heed the order of Henry Sabee,
Key Club proprietor to drop
his gun. Hockett is in General
hospital with a bullet wound in
his skull.
Sabee fired two shots, one of
them presumably wounded Cedi
Carter, 35, a patron, 899 Charles
Av., St Paul who was seated at a
table in the club. Carter is in Gen
eral hospital in poor condition.
Conflicting stories of the trouble
spread quickly over the two cities.
A story that Hockett was shot
while being held by Key Club of
ficials proved false and without
foundation.
Police reports indicate Hockett,
an employe of Flonheim Shoe
Store, resented two employes of
the club asking that he not leave
the building with a glass contain
ing whisky. They told him it was
against the law.
When Hockett angrily demurred
and crashed the glass and its con
tents against the wall, he was
ejected from the dub by Antoine
Wilson and Audrey Doughty, form
er police officer and longtime Key
Club employe.
Sabos who saw the incident from
a table near his office did not have
to intervene in the incident
A few minutes later Hockett
brushed by the doorman, ordering
him out of the way, cursing wildly
and entered the dub. According
to reports he cursed loudly and
profanely and waved a pistol in
the air as the 100 customers and
employes listened, startled. He said
something to effect that he was
tired of re pushing him around
and that he was going to shoot
the man who put him out
Sabee who was seated talking to
two detectives got up pulling a
small gun which he carries near
closing time as the cash registers
are emptied and moved toward
Hockett, telling him to drop his
gun.
Hockett continued his harangue
and refused to drop his pistol
witnesses say. Sabes shot at him
once and missed him. A second
shot felled the man.
The place was in a bedlam by
this time. The police were called
and ambulances summoned. Both
men, Hockett and the innocent by
stander Carter were taken to the
hospital. Police arrived and took
statements from patrons and em
ployee.
Two Minneapolis detectives on a
routine check from the police auto
theft section were In the club at
the time of the fracas. Both of
them said the shooting oocured so
quick they did not have time to
Intervene or attempt to subdue
Hockett The detectives were Rus
sell Stenberg and William Pettota.
A thorough police department
check of the circumstances sur
rounding the shooting a police of
ficial said Tuesday, with state
ments from Sabea, from club em
ployes, the two detectives in the
place and disinterested persons who
were patrons’ reveal very clearly
that Hockett did make a threaten
ing gun play. All witnesses ques
tioned who were dose to the scene

said Hockett had a gun.
Hockett who is on probation
from a burglary charge sentence
has Insisted he had no gun. Police
scout this because his admission
that he had a gun would automati
cally violate his probation.
Sabes’ own story was that when
he saw Hockett waving the gun
he became alarmed because of the
large number of patrons in his
establishment and rushed towards
Hockett, demanding that he drop
his weapon.
Sabes was crestfallen after the
occurence but asked “what Is a
proprietor of a business supposed
to do when a armed man begins to
go berserk, endangering the lives
of patrons?""
Sabes was cleared of another
shooting which occured in 1957
when in a gun duel he fatally
wounded Maurice Talley, a part
time muscian. The grand jury
would not indict Talley pulled a
gun In the South of the Border,
the bar adjoining the Key Club
and operated by Sabee, and began
to shoot up the placet
Sabes entered the bar from the
Key Club and ordered Talley to
drop his gun but he refused and
a gun battle ensued which proved
fatal to the latter. It transpired
that he had previously pulled a
revolver in the bar and had been
disarmed several months before.
At the time of the Talley shoot
ing an attempt was made to in
flame the community against the
Key Club owner on the racial is
sue.
However this fell flat because in

The Fourth annual St Paul
Labor Institute for Human Rela

Highland Park Junior High School
was well attended.
A panfl on housing drew the
most Intense interest
At this panel Earl McGee, presi
dent of Loafers, Inc., raised ques
tions which were critical of city
officials, housing officials and the
civic leadership for the manner in
which the housing needs of the
Negro minority were handled.
The panel discussion on “Chang
ing Concepts in Housing,” with
Norton Kent, director of planning

ty; Ernest Cooper, of the Urban

dent of the Metro Corp.
One of the panelists told how

scatter the families displaced by
the Western Re-Development Pro-'
ject met with community-wide op
position.
Mr. McGee's question as to those
specifically responsible for the op
position brought no direct answer
he told reporters after the meet
ing.
McGee cited the public housing
program as it applies to the Hol
low Playground program recently
approved by the city Council as an
example of the attempt under the
guise of providing housing to
maintain the ghetto system of
keeping all Negro families concen
trated in one section of the city.
Both McGee and John Stanley,
a member of the Loafers civic
committee, asked for a change in
attitudes of citizens and a drastic
change in officials* action, especial
ly those who allow the rights of
the minorities to be trampled un
der foot .

without dissent:
""Whereas, the name of William

ted to the Senate for confirmation

State Legislature Passes
Fair Housing Measure;
Is Ninth In Nation
The Minnesota Senate Thursday, April 13, with a favorable
vote of 36 to 30 passed the controversial Fair Housing bill. In
doing so the Senate followed the lead of the House of Representa
tives which the day before passed the bill by a vote of 84 to 41,
a two to one margin.
Monday afternoon Governor Elmer Andersen signed the
bill which made Minnesota the ninth state in the union to enact
a law to combat race and religi
ous discrimination in the housing
and real estate Industry.
Legislative sponsors of the bill
from both houses gathered Monday
with the Governor to witness the
signing with representatives at the
Minnesota Council for Human and
Civil Rights, which with the coop
eration of other human relations
organisations spear-headed the six
year drive to pass the bill.
FeMt Surprise Opponent
Surprise opponent of the bill in
the Senate was Senator Dan Feidt,
conservative of the 34th district
Feidt. a former civil rights advo
cate was a leader for the FEPC
bill when it was enacted in 1952.
This session he pulled out “all
stops’* to kill the Fair Housing
measure by attempting to attach
crippling amendments to the bill.
He sought to have the Senate
judiciary committee reject the
measure. Failing in this by a
Sen. Root Seo. Don Feidt
close vote he fought the measure
all the way, on the Senate floor.
Feidt fought vigorously against
giving the bill a special order on
April 12, despite (Gov. Andersen’s
appeal) saying, “other items are
more important for us to spend a
half-day in debate.""
m the- S sente after support W
Gov. Andersen for a “special or
der"" was victorious by a vote of
45 to IS.
Feidt the next day introduced
one amendment which would have
eliminated the law's exemption of
single-family dwellings, most of
which were not covered by the
bill. Thia amendment lost by a
vote of 27-3®.
His second amendment would
have excluded financial institu
tions and other property financ
ing firms/ This amendment lost 48
to 18.
Feidt is said to be a good friend
and associate of former state Sen
ator Marvin Anderson one of the
top homebuilders in the area who
has fought the bill.
Another amendment by Sen.
Charles Root, Minneapolis Conserv
ative from the Minneapolis 33rd
district would have required news
paper advertisements for the sale
or rental of housing to specify the
sale price or rental figure. This
amendment almost got through,
but was defeated by a tie vote, 31
to 31.
In the Senate rules call a tie
vote on a biU a nay vote.
In the State Senate 10 conserva
tives joined 21 liberals in secur
ing a 38 to 31 vote for the Min
nesota Fair Housing bill on April
13.

most of whom are members of

Key Club Scene of Shooting:
Angered Berserk Man
Shot By Proprietor As
He Threatens With Gun
Two night club customers were shot early Friday night,
April 14, in Minneapolis when the proprietor of the place in an
effort to stop a gun waving patron from shooting club bouncers,
who had previously ejected him, shot one man and a stray bullet
struck the other. The shooting occured near closing time.
The man whom club employes and patrons said came back
in the club waving a gun, shouting profane epithets and threat
ening to kill the employes who
ejected him is Richard Hockett,
30, 3565 Portland Ave.
Hockett was shot when he failed
to heed the order of Henry Sabes,
Key Club proprietor to drop
his gun. Hockett is in General
hospital with a bullet wound in
his skuU.
Sabes fired two shots, one of
them presumably wounded Cecil
Carter, 35, a patron, 899 Charles
Av., St. Paul who was seated at a
table in the club. Carter is in Gen
eral hospital in poor condition.
Conflicting stories of the trouble
spread quickly over the two cities.
A story that Hockett was shot
while being held by Key Club of
ficials proved false and without
foundation.
Police reports indicate Hockett,
an employe of Florsheim Shoe
Store, resented two employes of
the club asking that he not leave
the building with a glass contain
ing whisky. They told him it was
against the law.
When Hockett angrily demurred
and crashed the glass and its con
tents against the wall, he was
ejected from the club by Antoine
Wilson and Audrey Doughty, form
er police officer and longtime Key
Club employe.
Sabes who saw the incident from
a table near his office did not have
to intervene in the incident.
A few minutes later Hockett
brushed by the doorman, ordering
him out of the way, cursing wildly
and entered the club. According
to reports he cursed loudly and
profanely and waved a pistol in
the air as the 100 customers and
employes listened, startled. He said
something to effect that he was
tired of ... rs pushing him around
and that he was going to shoot
the man who put him out
Sabes who was seated talking to
two detectives got up pulling a
small gun which he carries near
closing time as the cash registers
are emptied and moved toward
Hockett, telling him to drop his
gun.
Hockett continued his harangue
and refused to drop his pistol
witnesses say. Sabes shot at him
once and missed him. A second
shot felled the man.
The place was In a bedlam by
this time. The police were called
and ambulances summoned. Both
men, Hockett and the Innocent by
stander Carter were taken to the
hospital. Police arrived and took
statements from patrons and em
ployes.
Two Minneapolis detectives on a
routine check from the police auto
theft section were in the club at
the time of the fracas. Both of
them said the shooting occured so
quick they did not have time to
intervene or attempt to subdue
Hockett. The detectives were Rus
sell Stenberg and William Pettola.
A thorough police department
check of the circumstances sur
rounding the shooting a police of
ficial said Tuesday, with state
ments from Sabes, from club em
ployes, the two detectives in the
place and disinterested persons who
were patrons' reveal very clearly
that Hockett did make a threaten
ing gun play. All witnesses ques
tioned who were close to the scene

said Hockett had a gun.
Hockett who is on probation
from a burglary charge sentence
has insisted he had no gun. Police
scout this because his admission
that he had a gun would automati
cally violate his probation.
Sabes’ own story was that when
he saw Hockett waving the gun
he became alarmed because of the
large number of patrons in his
establishment and rushed towards
Hockett, demanding that he drop
his weapon.
Sabes was crestfallen after the
occurence but asked ""what is a
proprietor of a business supposed
to do when a armed man begins to
go berserk, endangering the lives
of patrons?”
Sabes was cleared of another
shooting which occured in 1957
when in a gun duel he fatally
wounded Maurice Talley, a part
time muscian. The grand jury
would not indict. Talley pulled a
gun in the South of the Border,
the bar adjoining the Key Club
and operated by Sabes, and began
to shoot up the place.
Sabes entered the bar from the
Key Club and ordered Talley to
drop his gun but he refused and
a gun battle ensued which proved
fatal to the latter. It transpired
that he had previously pulled a
revolver in the bar and had been
disarmed several months before.
At the time of the Talley shoot
ing an attempt was made to in
flame the community against the
Key Club owner on the racial is
sue.
However this fell flat because in
the 25 years Sabes has operated
the South of the Border and the

At Human Relations Institute:
Loafers* President
Sharply Critical Of
Housing Situation
The Fourth annual St Paul
Labor Institute for Human Rela

Highland Park Junior High School
was well attended.
A panel on housing drew the
most intense interest.
| At this panel Earl McGee, presi
dent of Loafers, Inc., raised ques
tions which were critical of city
officials, housing officials and the
civic leadership for the manner in
which the housing needs of the
Negro minority were handled.
The panel discussion on “Chang
ing Concepts in Housing,” with
Norton Kent, director of planning
for the St. Paul Housing Authori
ty; Ernest Cooper, of the Urban
League and Victor Lapakko, presi
dent of the Metro Corp.
One of the panelists told how
the Housing Authority sought to
scatter the families displaced by
the Western Re-Development Pro
ject met with community-wide op
position.
Mr. McGee's question as to those
specifically responsible for the op
position brought no direct answer
he told reporters after the meet
ing.
McGee cited the public housing
program as it applies to the Hol
low Playground program recently
approved by the city Council as an
example of the attempt under the
guise of providing housing to
maintain the ghetto system of
keeping all Negro families concen
trated in one section of the city.
Both McGee and John Stanley,
a member of the Loafers civic
committee, asked for a change in
attitudes of citizens and a drastic
change in officials’ action, especial
ly those who allow the rights of
the minorities to be trampled un
der foot.
Awards were presented to Local
No. 4, of the United Packing House
Worker’s Union; Carl Winn, re
gional director of the AFL-CIO
and the Rev. Fr. Edward Grzesk
owiak, professor of mathematics
at Nazerth Hall. All three were

Brief Notes On
Fair Housing Victory
In Legislature
A surprise vote in the House in
favor was by Rep. Alf L. Bergerud
of the 36th district (Edina) who
was outspoken against the mea-
Rev. G. Wright Rep. Bergerud
sure until voting time but. then
cast a yes vote on the final ballot.
Bergerud is president of Red Owl
stores.
Bergerud was first elected to
the legislature from the 30th dis
trict, which at the time had a
large voter population of racial
and religious minorities. A smart
operator, Bergerud might have
seen the handwriting on the wall
and decided to vote yes.
I Rep. F. Gordon Wright of the
34th district’s long speech against
House passage lost his side votes.
The name of Rep. George French
of the 33rd district in Minneapolis
was inadvertently left out of the
list of Representatives voting
against the Fair Housing bill, car-
Rep. McCarthy Rep. Geo. French
ried in this newspaper's account of
the balloting in the April 14 edi
tion.
Representative Glen McCarty of
the 34 th district was Incorrectly
credited in our April 14 edition
with voting for the Fair Housing
bill. Instead Rep. McCarty, a Min
neapolis conservative, voted against
I Fair Housing.
While active supporters of the
measure did not openly admit it
prior to the final outcome, most
of them did not expect the mea
sure to pass the conservative con
trolled Senate this session.
Sen. Dan Feidt did get the mea
sure amended in the Senate jud
iciary committee so that it would
not become effective before Dec.
31, 1962.
Supporters of the bill in both
houses although recognizing this
was a delaying tactic, agreed to
the amendment. To fight it might
have meant no bill, and proponents
crossed up opposition strategy by
agreeing to the 1962 date which
in effect means January, 1963.
Governor Elmer Andersen was
equal in praise of liberals and con
servatives for the enactment of
the Fair Housing bill.
In praising proponents who
lobbied for the measure, Gov.
Andersen singled out Leonard 11.
Carter, NAACP regional direc
tor, a St. Paul resident, and
Mrs. Charles (Josie) Johnson of
Minneapolis for special praise.
Richardson Okie, St. Paul civic
leader said ""the eloquent effective
speech of Cecil Newman, Twin
City newspaper editor at the first

Senate Liberals
Back Cratic In
Unanimous Caucas
At a meeting of the Senate DFL
Caucus Monday, April 17 the fol
lowing resolution was adopted
without dissent:
""Whereas, the name of William
Cratic of Minneapolis was submit
ted to the Senate for confirmation
as a member of the Fair Employ
ment Practices Commission, and
""WHEREAS, such confinnation
was not given during this session
of the legislature, and
“WHEREAS, information avail
able to the Senate DFL Caucus
indicates that William Cratic is a
person of high moral character and
possessing intelligent concern for
problems of minority groups,
“NOW, THEREFORE, the Sen
ate DFL Caucus expresses its con
fidence in William Cratic and his
ability to continue his excellent
public service as a member of the
Fair Employment Practices Com
mission.”
Confirmation of Cratic, a state
leader in the civil rights move
ment. was blocked last week by
objection of Sen. Charles Root,
Conservative of the 33rd district in
Minneapolis.
Cratic was not “moderate”
enough Root claimed.

Bill Outlawing Housing Bias Approved:
State Legislature Passes
Fair Housing Measure;
Is Ninth In Nation
The Minnesota Senate Thursday, April 13, with a favorable
vote of 36 to 30 passed the controversial Fair Housing bill. In
doing so the Senate followed the lead of the House of Representa
tives which the day before passed the bill by a vote of 84 to 41,
a two to one margin.
Monday afternoon Governor Elmer Andersen signed the
bill which made Minnesota the ninth state in the union to enaet
a law to combat race and religi
ous discrimination in the housing
and real estate industry
Legislative sponsors of the bill
from both houses gathered Monday
with the Governor to witness the
signing with representatives of the
Minnesota Council for Human and
Civil Rights, which with the coop
eration of other human relations
organizations spear-headed the six
year drive to pass the bill.
Feidt Surprise Opponent
Surprise opponent of the bill in
the Senate was Senator Dan Feidt,
conservative of the 34 th district.
Feidt, a former civil rights advo
cate was a leader for the FEPC
bill when it was enacted in 1952.
This session he pulled out ‘‘all
stops” to kill the Fair Housing
measure by attempting to attach
crippling amendments to the bill.
He sought to have the Senate
judiciary committee reject the I
measure. Failing in this by a
wl** CL®
Sen. Root ' Dan Feidt
close vote he fought the measure
all the way, on the Senate floor.
Feidt fought vigorously against
giving the bill a special order on
April 12, despite (Gov. Andersen’s
appeal) saying, ""other Items are
more Important for us to spend a
half-day in debate.""
In the Senate after support by
Gov. Andersen for a ""special or
der” was victorious by a vote of
45 to 16.
Feidt the next day introduced
one amendment which would have
eliminated the law’s exemption of
single-family dwellings, most of
which were not covered by the
bill. This amendment lost by a
vote of 27-36.
His second amendment would
have excluded financial institu
tions and other property financ
ing firms. This amendment lost 46
to 16.
Feidt is said to be a good friend
and associate of former state Sen
ator Marvin Anderson one of the
top homebuilders in the area who
has fought the bill.
Another amendment by Sen.
Charles Root, Minneapolis Conserv
ative from the Minneapolis 33rd
district would have required news
paper advertisements for the sale
or rental of housing to specify the
sale price or rental figure. This
amendment almost got through,
but was defeated by a tie vote, 31
to 31.
In the Senate rules call a tie
vote on a bill a nay vote.
In the State Senate 15 conserva
tives joined 21 liberals in secur
ing a 36 to 31 vote for the Min
nesota Fair Housing bill on April
13.
A total of 27 Conservatives,
most of whom are members of
the Republican party voted against
the measure which would combat

He told supporters of the mea

convictions which were not neces

In his newsletter explanation in
the Hasting GAZETTE he wrote,
""I cannot see where this kind of
legislation is sound or for the bet

South St. Paul, the community
from which Thuet comes has a
long record of unfriendliness to
Negroes who sought housing there
and only a very few Negroes reside
there.
His district has some of the
housing developments which re
fuse to sell homes to Negroes and
which are the target of the Fair
Housing bill.
There are two Orrin Thompson
company developments in Thuet’s
district. They are Thompson Grove
and Thompson Park. The Marvin
Anderson firm has at least one
development in the district.

Vice President Tells Indian Peasants

to join in the attack on ignor
ance, poverty and disease.
""The conquest of these every
where is the first step to the
assurance of peace and free
dom.” the communique said in
a resume of two days of talks
by the two men. ,
In Nagla Pati Ram (nagla
means hamlet and Pati Ram
ia the name of the 86-year-old
founder of the tiny village who
welcomed Mr. Johnson at the
entrance) the Vice President
was greeted by a brass band.
Given Hindu Tribute
As Mr. Johnson stopped, a
bearded and mustached old
man with glazed eyes bent ever
quickly and touched tne Vice
President’s right shoe with a
hand wetted from the old
man’s lips. This is a tribute In
dian Hindus pay to persons
deemed divine. All very impor
tant men are regarded by old
Hindus as incarnations of some
god.
Mr. Nehru angrily waves
peasants away when they try to
touch his shoes. He says it is
unfitting far a democratic na
tion to pay such a tribute to
an elected leader. But after
his initial surprise Mr. John
son liked the idea and tried to
get the old man to repeat the
gesture for photographers. Em
barrassed, the old man refused.
Later, in another village,
several women touched the
shoes of Mr. Johnson and his
wife and of President Ken
nedy’s sister, Mrs. Jean Smith.
The touring Texan was up at
daybreak and breakfasted with
Prime Minister Nehru before
leaving New Delhi for this
tourist mecca 110 miles south
of the capital.
Mr. Nehru left Delhi on a
tour to India’s northeast fron
tier territory, bordering Red
China.
Long Conference Held
The two leaders conferred for
nearly five hours yesterday,
mostly about India’s third five
year development plan, which
needs about $1 billion a year
in foreign support.
Mr. Nehru told reporters the
talks ""went off very well,” but
there was no announcement
that Mr. Johnson made any
specific commitments. The
United States Government is
now negotiating with its major
Western allies on the amount
each will contribute to aid
India.
Mr. Nehru said they has dis
cussed economic problems of all
underdeveloped countries, not
just India’s.
Mr. Johnson was to return to
New Delhi later in the day for
more talks with Indian eco
nomic officials.

request for retirement as he
told friends last year he would
do. Admiral Arleigh A. Burke,
chief of Naval Operations, ends
three consecutive tours this
summer. His future plans have
not been stated.
Pentagon civilian officials In
the new administration have
commented frequently In pri
vate about the “poor staff
work” of the services and the
Joint Chiefs and their staff)
One general complaint is that
the military planners have not
produced the thorough and ob
jective studies necessary for top
level ciivllan decisions.
Lemnitser Disturbed
Some of the chiefs, including
Gen. Lemnitzer, have let it be
known that they are disturbed
by the criticism of their work,
but they have declined to give
their side of the argument to
reporters. Their stated reason
is that there have been too
many attempts to shift the
blame for the Cuban fiasco and
they do not want to join the
game.
Before today’s Senate hearing
began, Senator Morse said sub
committee members wanted to
know ""who originated the order
bringing the military into prep
arations for the invasion” and
whether ""signals were changed”
after it got under way.
""We are trying to find out
“what the full extent of our’’
military participation was, and
also why,” Senator Morse added.
“We’d like to know what
changes in orders, if any, were
given in the final days before
the exiles Invaded, or possibly
on the day the invasion was
attempted. Some Cuban ex
iles have said signals were
changed.”
Senator Church said before
the hearing that on the basis
of testimony so far it ap
peared the Joint Chiefs of
Staff ""had a very critical role
to play in the invasion.”
""It may be the role played
by the military was more sig
nificant than that played
by the Central Intelligence
Agency,” he commented.
Senator Delays
Crime Meeting
A scheduled meeting of the
Senate District Committee and
the District Law Enforcement
Council, to discuss the increase
in crime here, has been post
poned until Monday by Sena
tor Bible, Democrat of Nevada.

to both the committee and the

Vientiane Shifts Stand;
Peace Talks Bog Down
BAN NAMONE, Laos, May 19 1
(AP). Laotian peace talks ,
were stalled again today when
the right-wing royal govern
ment changed its position and
said cease fire details should be ’
discussed before negotiations to 1
form a coalition government. 1
The Vientiane government '
said it was returning to its J
original stand because fighting
had increased and “We can- ’
'not discuss politics while Lao 1
soldiers are being killed.” '
Representatives of the pro- <
Communist Pathet Lao rebels
and Prince Souvanna Phouma’s
so-called neutralists said some
incidents were unavoidable. 1
They argued the three Laotian 1
factions should stick by their 1
Wednesday agreement to make (

2 Minor Amendments
To School Bill Beaten
By DAVID 8. BRODER
Star Staff Writer
The Senate today defeated
two minor amendments to the
school aid bill,, then turned to
debate the issue of how Fed
eral funds should be shared
among the States.
The manager of the bill,
Senator Morse, Democrat of
Oregon, predicted the measure
would pass next week “without
any crippling amendments.”
Called into session at 9 am.
—three hours earlier than usual
—in an effort to speed action
on the major Kennedy admin
istration proposal, the Sena
tors quickly disposed of two
relatively unimportant amend
ments.
The first, offered by Senator
Cotton, Republican of New
Hampshire, was a substitute
which would have turned back
to each State 3 cents of the 8-
cent Federal tax on cigarettes
sold in that State. It was de
feated, 63-29.
Proxmire Also Loses
The second amendment, by
Senator Proxmire, Democrat of
Wisconsin, was beaten, 73-22.
It was a technical change to
convert the financing of the
bill from Federal grants to tax
sharing, without affecting the
division of funds among the
States.
Two Republicans, Senators
Javits of New York and Cooper
of Kentucky, then called up
their amendment which Would
basically revise the committee
approved distribution formula.
The chief differences be
tween the Cooper-Javits for
mula and the committee for
mula are:
1. The Cooper-Javits formula
is based on public school at
tendance, while the committee
formula is based on total school
age population.
2. The Cooper-Javits formula
would provide S2O a year per
public school pupil to all States, i
with a bonus payment to low
income States designed to bring
the general Impression: “Ob
viously these meetings are go
ing to last some time.”
A neutralist delegate reported
that two American flyers and
an American television camera
man missing since their heli
copter went down in rebel ter
ritory are alive and well.
Presumably they are prison
ers of the Pathet Lao. but
Pathet Lao delegates said only
they had not heard of the in
cident and would check.
Seen in Rice Field
The Americans aboard the
helicopter when it went down
Monday 50 miles northeast of
Vientiane are NBC cameraman
Grant Wolfkill of Shelton,
Wash., and Hong Kong; Pilot
Edward R. Shore of Gallaway,
Tenn., and Flight Mechanic
John P. McMorrow of Brooklyn.
The helicopter was spotted in
a rice field, apparently undam
aged, by air searchers Wednes
day.
Five other Americans have
been captured by the Pathet
Lao, but the rebels have given
no direct word on them.
them up to a ""minimum foun
dation standard” of education.
The bonuses would go to seven
States in the first year and 15
States in the third year of the
program. The range of pay
ments in the third year would
be S2O per public school pupil
to $65.48.
The committee formula, by
contrast, calls for a gradual
increase in payments per
school-age child between the
very rich and very poor States.
The range in all three years
would be from $9.26 per school
age child to $27.79.
3. The Cooper-Javits for
mula would increase the share
of Federal funds that would go
to 14 States and the District of
I Columbia. The beneficiaries
would be the States at the ex
tremes of the income range,
the very rich and the very poor.
Tlje committee formula would
give a larger share of the
money to the 35 States in the
middle of the income range. ,
4. The Cooper-Javits formula I
would reduce the three-year
cost of the program from $2.55
billion to $2.2 biljion, a saving
of $326 million.
""Grab Bag” Condemned
Senator Cooper condemned
the committee formula as a
“grab bag approach” to the dis
tribution of funds. He said he
hoped it would be changed
even though his own State of
Kentucky would lose $27 mil
lion over the next three years
by the substitution of the
Cooper-Javits formula.
The Kentucky Senator said
the committee was ""rubbing
salt in the wounds of Catholic
school children” by counting
i them in determining how much
money each State would re
ceive but denying use of the
Federal funds in parochial
schools.
Senator Morse claimed to
[have the votes to beat the
'Cooper-Javits amendment and'
all other major changes in the i
bill. |

""The President and Chair
man Khrushchev understand

purpose of negotiating or
reaching agreement on the
major international problems

opportunity for the first per
sonal contact between them
and a general exchange of
views on the major issues
which affect the relationship
between the two countries.
“From Vienna the President
plans to proceed to London

al days.”
Departure Uncertain
In issuing the announce
ment, Press Secretary Pierre
Salinger said it was not yet
determined whether the Ken
nedys would leave Vienna for
London the night of June 4 or
the morning of June 5. He said
the present plan is for them
to go to Vienna from Paris on
the morning of June 3.
Asked if the President
planned to make a speech to
the country explaining the pur
pose of his meeting with the
Soviet Premier before he leaves
for Europe, Mr. Salinger said.
“I know of no plans for such a
speech at the moment.”
Mr. Salinger and Kenneth
O'Donnell, the President's ap
pointments secretary, plan to
fly to Vienna next Monday
morning to arrange for the
President’s visit.
Mr. Salinger said they plan

Senator Blakley
Selling His Stock
In Braniff Line
DALLAS. May 19 (AP).—
Senator William A. Blakley
of Dallas today said he and the
Blakley-Braniff Foundation are
selling their multi-million dol
lar interest in Braniff Interna
tional Airways to four Dallas
businessmen.
The purchasers in the $13.5
million transaction are J. Erik
Jonsson, chairman of Texas
Instruments, Inc.; Eugene Mc-
Dermott. Cecil Green and P. E.
Haggerty.
Senator Blakley said the deal
involves slightly more than a
million shares in Braniff Air
ways.
The Senator, now serving by
interim appointment and can
didate in a May 27 election for
the unexpired term of Vice
President Lyndon B. Johnson,
said he feels he could best rep
resent Texans by divesting
himself of both his Braniff
stock and the responsibilities it
entailed.

""and Barry turned toward it,”
said Al Milham. president of
the Temple City League, who
umpired behind the plate.
“Barry staggered back after|
the ball hit him. and I caught

my arms and was gone before
I could put him down.”
In Philadelphia, officials said
it was the first fatality in Little
League competition.
Mike Hanes, who pitched the
fatal curve, collapsed in tears.
“I know the boy doesn't have
a father, so I tried to comfort
him.” said Mr. Babcock, a sales
man.
“I told him right there that
I'd be out there at his next
game to see him pitch.”

Mr. Salinger said the exten
sion of the President's trip to

... have had closer relations
with United States authorities
than any other Korean
i agency.”
Gen. Chang disclosed that he
had met within the past 36
j hours with Gen. Carter B. Ma
gruder, the American chief of
the United Nations command
who along with United States
Charge d’Affaires Marshall
Green had publicly opposed the
military coup. Gen. Chang re
fused to say what he and Gen.
Magruder said to each other.
Despite statements by Gen.
Magruder and Mr. Green, Gen.
Chang said he did not feel the
United States had interfered
in Korea's domestic affairs.
And he said he personally
felt the 11-year-old U. N. com
mand the supreme military
command in Korea since the
Korean war—should be con
tinued and strengthened.
Gen. Magruder will be re
placed June 30, as scheduled,
i by Lt. Gen. Guy S. Meloy. Gen.
Magruder is retiring.
Mr. Green is acting head of
the Embassy but will soon get a
new boss. Ambassador Samuel
D. Berger. President Kennedy
had appointed Mr. Berger be
fore the revolt.
In Washington. Undersecre
tary of State Chester Bowles
said the “United States can
hardly cheer at the upsetting
of a constitutional government”
but that he thought the new
regime would be recognized.
A spokesman for the United
States operation mission, which
this year will dispense some
S2OO million in aid to South
Korea, said work was resumed
yesterday on all projects on the
planning boards or under con
struction.
Voice of America Banned
As censorship was broadened,
Korean radio stations were
ordered to quit relaying the
Voice of America’s twice-a-day
news programs In the Korean
language. The object was to
keep any criticism of the mili
tary government from the
people.
Gen. Chang told a news con
ference, however, he would
take immediate steps to lift
the ban on the Voice of Amer
ica rebroadcasts. He also said
he would “take steps very
shortly in the direction of a
good settlement” of the censor
ship.
Newspapers were carefully
checked by censors. Anything
critical of the army revolt was
deleted from both local stories
and dispatches from overseas.
The papers also were ordered
to quit publishing blank or
scarred spaces to indicate
censored matter.
Newsmen were told the only
information they could publish
from the Foreign Ministry
would be given to them once
daily at the ministry’s informa
tion section.
Cameramen Threatened
Guards openly threatened
local and foreign cameramen
with loss of their film is they
took photographs without per
mission.
Competent sources said 10
newsmen were under arrest.
Publishers of Seoul dailies met
and decided to appeal to the
junta to relax censorship' and
prevent mistreatment of news
men by troops.
Foreign correspondents so far
(were able to file outgoing dis
patches without Interference,
but photo shipments were cen
sored.
Two generals who disagreed
| with the rebel junta—Lt. Gens.
Lee Han-lin and Kang Yung
Hoon—were reported arrested.
Gen. Lee, commander of the
huge Ist Field Army, had first
told his troops to stay neutral
toward the coup. Later Seoul
radio broadcast a statement
of support for the coup from
him, but there were Indications
ihe was already under arrest
when it was aired.
Commandant Held
Gen. Kang, commandant of
the Korean Military Academy,
reportedly was held because he
opposed a parade yesterday in
support of the coup by his 1,000
cadets. The march was the
first public demonstration in
support of the revolt.
The superintendent of the
Korean Air Academy led 500
of his cadets on a march
through downtown Seoul today
to whip up support for the
new government.
Gen. Chang made clear he
would allow no interference
from the civilian students
whose demonstration 13
months ago resulted in Syng
man Rhee's overthrow and who
had begun to demonstrate in
recent months against Premier
Chang.

President Gives
Housing Priority
A group of officials of the
National Association of Home
Builders said they were assured
, by President Kennedy today
| that housing would be “the
primary function” of a pro
posed new cabinet department
of urban affairs.

Bar Unit Ends Secrecy
On Judge Nomination
By PHIL THOMAS
Stir Butt Writer
The District Bar Association
last night voted—on its fifth
attempt—to make public the
names of those recommended'
by the organization to fill va
cant judgeships here.
After approving a measure
ending secrecy of such recom
mendations made to the Attor
ney General, the association
then installed a new president,
62 - year -old Edmund D.
Campbell, who succeeds Rich
ard W. Galiher.
The association approved
the public announcement of the
recommendations for judge
ships bw a vote of 155-59.
Under terms of the bylaws
amendment adopted last night,
the seven - member judicial
selections committee will be
elected by the association board
of directors. It then will be re
quired to report its recommen
dations to the board, which
shall then make a public an
nouncement concerning them.
The vote on the publicity re
quirement was the culmination
of an effort that started last
November by dissident mem
bers of the association to strike
down the secrecy bar.
Move Tabled
At that time an association
committee proposed a bylaws
amendment calling for a con
tinuance of the secrecy policy.
The suggested amendment was
tabled.
A second effort to resolve the
conflict failed in December
when heavy snows prevented a
quorum from showing up at a
meeting.
The proposed amendment was
again tabled in February, and
last March the organization
membership after lengthy
and heated debate—was unable
to come up with the required
vote of approval on any one of
six proposals.
Last night a compromise
amendment was offered which
would have left up to the board
of directors whether or not it
should make the recommended
names public. This amendment
was adopted, but the member
ship then went on immediately
to require that the names shall
be made public—without leav
ing this to the board’s discre
tion.
Broadened Authority
Another step was taken as a
result of the vote to broaden
the work of the selections com
mittee. The association ap
proved a proposal allowing the
committee to recommend names
for appointment “to other judi
cial or public offices in which
the association may be inter
ested” when directed to do so
by the board of directors.
In previous years the selec
tions committee has limited its
consideration of recommenda
tions to the District Court, the
United States Court of Appeals,
the Municipal Court, and Muni
cipal Court of Appeals, the
Juvenile Court for the Dis
trict, and the District Tax
Court.
The new association presi
dent. Mr. Campbell, has been a
practicing attorney in the Dis
trict since 1925. He is a mem
ber of the law firm of Douglas,
Obear and Campbell.
He has been first vice presi
dent of the association and has
served the organization in
many other capacities. He was
graduated from Washington
and Lee University, receiving
his law degree from that
school, and has a master of
arts degree from Harvard Uni
versity.
Defeated Donohue
Elected as a result of mail
balloting by more than 1,900
members of the 3,000-member
bar association, he defeated F.
Joseph (Jiggs) Donohue, former
District Commissioner.

elected first vice president, with
David C. Bastian being re
elected secretary and Charles
Effinger Smoot, re-elected
treasurer.
Oliver Gasch, who recently
stepped down as United States
attorney here to enter private
law practice, was elected a
member of the association
board of directors. At the same
time the association presented
a certificate of appreciation for
“outstanding service to the
bench and bar of the District”
while serving as the chief pros
ecutor here from April of 1956
until last April.
The association also honored
Alphonzo Washington Freeman,
78-year-old librarian of the as
sociation law library. Mr. Free
man, retiring after 61 years of
service in the law library, re
ceived $2,500 as a gift from the
association and its members, in
addition to the pension he will
receive.
In addition to Mr. Gasch,
other members of the board of
directors elected last night are
Sidney S. Sachs, Fontaine
Bradley, Bernard J. Gallagher
and Eugene C. Carusi. Associa
tion trustees elected are Frede
rick M. Bradley, A. Kenneth
Pye and Jacob A. Stein.
Chicagoan Slain
Gangland Style
CHICAGO, June 14 (AP).—
The body of L. C. Smith, 39,
victim of what police consider
a gangland-style abduction, was
found yesterday, shot five
times through the head in an
auto parked in the financial
j district.
A traffic patrolman found
Mr. Smith, a delivery truck
driver, lying face down on the
floor of the rear seat as the
officer was writing a parking
ticket.
Witnesses told police Smith’s
car had been forced to the
curb by an auto containing four
men. Two of the men forced
their way into Mr. Smith’s car
and drove away with him.
Vietnamese Kill
44 Red Rebels
SAIGON, South Viet Nam.
June 14 (AP). —South Viet
Nam authorities today reported
at least 44 Communist rebels
were killed and more than a
dozen captured in scattered
clashes over the past week. No
government losses were an
nounced.
The government said one
band of Viet Cong guerrillas
tried to assassinate Maj. Ho
Van Phang, chief of Phuoc Tuy
province, as he was returning
from an inspection tour. Maj.
Ho’s escort troops beat off the
attack, killed one rebel and put

evening star.,['Washington'],1961-06-15,"First 'UncontaminatecT Meteorite
Recovered Is Sent to Smithsonian
Scientists have made the first
recovery of a meteorite in a
""virtually uncontaminated’’
state, the Smithsonian Institu
tion announced today,
The 18% -pound meteorite
was recovered May 20 after
blazing across the sky and
crashing into a sandy ridge
near Harleton, Tex., E. P. Hen
derson. associate curator at the
Smithsonian, said.
He said all other recoveries
of meteorites have been made
too late for testing and analyz
ing the meteorites’ elements be
fore they were broken down by
the earth’s atmosphere.
The meteorite was cut in
half at the Smithsonian today.
Next week, American and Rus
sian meteorologists will begin
testing portions of the meteor
ite, the first known to fall in
the United States since Octo
ber, 1959.
Content to Be Studied
They will attempt to ascer
tain something of the content
and structure of matter out
side the earth’s atmosphere.
Previous finds had deterio
rated to such an extent that
their testing by scientists pro
vided little or no information
about their origination or
flight, Mr. Henderson said.
He said last month’s me
teorite was observed by a young
boy as it began burning when
it entered the earth’s atmos
phere.
The boy’s father, J. J. Carver
of Harleton, made the recovery
after his son led him to the
area where the meteorite
crashed in the sand, according
to Mr. Henderson. (
Found in 10 Minutes
“The meteorite was located
within a matter of 10 minutes,
buried in a small sand crater
about 25 to 30 inches deep,”
Mr. Henderson said.
“The fast recovery and care
ful handling of the rock will
enable meteorologists to study
the rock while it’s still free
from terrestial contamination.
“Usually, people try to do
foolish tricks with meteorites—
they pour acid on them, heat
them or try to crack them open.
“Within 20 hours of the
time it fell, Oscar Monnig of
Fort Worth had acquired the
meteorite for us.”
Meteorite tests and measure
ment have to be made within
30 days to obtain accurate in
formation. he said.
“After 30 days, the elements
deteriorate and their evalua
tion would give us distorted in
formation,” Mr. Henderson
said.
Chunks Being Distributed
Chunks of half of the mete
orite will be sent to six labora
tories across the country and
to Russia, he said. Hie testing
is expected to begin next week.
The laboratories in this coun
try include Brookhaven in
Long Island, New York; Astro
physical in Cambridge, Mass.;

Social Security
Changes Win
Committee OK
The Senate Finance Commit
tee today approved the House
social security bill, liberalizing
old-age and disability retire
ment benefits.
The most important change
would give men the option al
ready held by women of retiring
at 62, instead of 65, on a re
duced annuity.
The Senate committee added
two amendments not related to
the social security system. One,
by Senator Russell Long, Dem
ocrat of Louisiana, would raise
the ceiling on the amount of
State relief checks toward which
the Federal Government con
tributes from |65 to $67.50 a
month.
The second amendment, of
fered for the administration by
Senator Smathers, Democrat of
Florida, would authorize the
Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare to provide tempo
rary financial help to American
citizens who have been forced
to return from Cuba and are
in need.
Backs Permanent Setup
These Americans and many
Cuban refugees have been pro
vided for temporarily out of a
presidential emergency fund.
But this amendment would give
permanent authority to take
care of American refugees who
may return from any country
because of a threat of war or
similar crisis.
Officials estimate that about
$300,000 would be needed in the
coming year to take care of
Americans forced to leave Cuba
until they get on their feet
financially.
The optional retirement pro
vision is expected to benefit
men in depressed areas whose
jobs have been abolished by
modern technology.
Other proposed changes in
the law would: .
Increase from $33 to S4O the
minimum monthly retirement
benefit for those who retire at
or after 65. ,
Liberalize the length of time
a person must work to acquire
insured status.
Would Aid Widows
Increase the benefits of wid
ows and other survivors of an
annuitant.
These increased benefits
would be financed by an in
crease in the payroll tax in
January from 3 to 3% per cent
each on employer and employe,
with a corresponding small in
crease in the tax on self
employed.
Senate r Long’s increased
Federal payment to relief re
cipients would be limited to
one year and would cost about
S2O million if all the States
take advantage of it.
The Federal Government
pays 80 per cent of the first
S3O of a relief check, and under
this amendment would pay
from 50 to 65 per cent of the
next $37.50, depending on the
per capita income of the State.
The committee turned down
three motions by Serjator Hart
ke. Democrat of Indiana, one
of which would have allowed
retired persons to earn up to
SI,BOO a year without any de
duction from their social se
curity benefit.
The committee also turned
down a move by Senator
Smathers to allow a child to
receive social security bene
fits as a dependent until age
21 if he or she were still in
school.

Rules Unit Puts Off
Vote on Housing Bill
Democratic leadership plans
for House debate on*a housing
bill next week became uncertain
today when the Rules Commit
tee announced It would not
start voting on the measure
before next Tuesday.
Sponsors of the legislation
said this was not necessarily a
bad sign. They interpreted it
as a possible indication that the
sessions would not be dragged
out, as has happened in the
past, to delay action.
Committee Chairman Smith,
Democrat of Virginia, said the
arrangement decided on today
at a closed session following the
first open hearing on the bill
did not constitute any commit
ment to vote Tuesday or any
other day. He said the com
mittee will resume hearings
Monday.
Clearance Appears Sure
Eventual clearance of the
bill seemed assured despite op
position by all five Republican
members and a few Democratic
members of the enlarged Rules
Committee.
Today’s hearing had only one
witness, Representative Rains,
Democrat of Alabama, the
Banking and Currency Com
mittee member in charge of the
$4.9 billion bill. He took much
of the opening session to ex
plain the complicated measure
containing most of President
Kennedy’s proposals for hous
ing legislation this year.
Calls It ""Ridiculous”

phases of the House bill as “ut
terly ridiculous.” He especially
criticized the House bill provi
sion, modified in the Senate
bill, for a program of 40-year
no-down-payment mortgages.
Senator Dirksen declared
that the vast housing program
proposed by President Ken
nedy was merely another in a
list of huge outlays that would
increase Federal spending next
year by at least $5 billion and
obligate $9 billion more under
contractual authority.
French Will Act
On 200 in Revolt
PARIS, June 15 (AP).—Pres
ident de Gaulle’s government
plans action against some 200
French officers as a result of
the military revolt in Algeria
last April.
Defense Minister Pierre
Messmer told the Defense Com
mittee yesterday that about 100
officers are marked for legal
proceedings and another 100
or so will be discharged from
the service.
He assured the committee
that the government would
move carefully to avoid any
thing like the widespread purge
of 1945, when many officers
were discharged on suspicion
of having collaborated with
the Germans.
Mr. Messmer said discharged
officers would retain their pen
sion rights and receive in
demnities.
Three generals have been
stripped of their rank and sen
tenced to 15 years in prison
each for their part in the revolt.

Jimmy Hoffa Rides Again
Whatever his basic objective may
be, President James R. Hoffa of the
Teamsters Union is operating from a
position of strength at the union’s
Miami Beach convention.
Mr, Hoffa’s strength rests on the
following* (1) While the AFL-CIO,
which expelled his outfit four years ago,
ihas been losing membership in the
meantime, the teamsters have picked up
an estimated 300,000 to bring their rolls
to approximately 1.7 million members;
<2) he has survived not only a rough
gping-over at the hands of the Senate
Rackets Committee but several legal
battles designed to remove him from
office, and (3) he has no serious oppo
sition to re-election this week as presl
dent of his union. Closely related to
the latter factor, and comparably
favored, are his plans for increasing
pier capita dues in order to hire more
professional organizers, to step up mem
bership drives in new fields, to raise the
Union’s strike benefits, to increase union
pensions—and perhaps to raise Mr.
Hoffa’s own salary.
< As far as his long-range planning
1$ concerned, Mr. Hoffa appears to be
strategically poised either to fight the
AFL-CIO (perhaps forming a new fed
eration under teamster domination), or
to rejoin the older group (pretty much
bn his own terms). With reference to
the first alternative, Mr. Hoffa was
reported as telling a press conference
that he has had conversations with
three other established unions about
possible affiliation with the teamsters.
Although he did not identify these
groups, there was speculation that he
might move into the construction, laun
dry and bakery fields. At the same time,
while emphasizing that the teamsters
“are not knocking on the door” of the
AFL-CIO, Mr. Hoffa added that his
union “would not turn down an offer to
return,” provided their organizing free
dom were not restricted.
Mr. Hoffa is not best known, of
course, for his modesty, and it is only
reasonable to assume that there is a
certain amount of bluster in his talk.
In challenging the big federation, if
that is really what he is doing, he is
not tilting with a straw man or with
opposition labor leaders who are timid
or unskilled. It is true, however, that
factional troubles never have been far
below the surface of the AFL-CIO and
that some of them have become in
creasingly obvious in recent months.
Currently, Mr. Hoffa has the advantage
of riding high—of a command position
that is undivided versus one that oper
ates by committee. How these two
forces work out their power struggle is
first of all of immediate concern to
organized labor. But it is also of great
concern to the Nation.
National Zoo
The decision that the Smithsonian
Institution after this year will bear the
expense of capital Improvements at the
Zoo will remove a burdensome and illog
ical load from the District government.
By no stretch of the imagination is the
Zoo a municipal enterprise. It is in
reality as much a national institution as
the Smithsonian itself, a fact that is
demonstrated by the administrative
control which the Smithsonian has exer
cised over the Zoo from its origin. Yet
for all these years, due to the arbitrary
decision of an earlier Congress, the tax
payers of Washington have been saddled
with its entire expense.
The assumption of capital improve
ments as a Federal responsibility recti
fies only a part of the wrong, however.
We hope that the same reasoning which
led to this change also will be extended
next year to cover the routine costs of
operating and maintaining the Zoo. If
it makes no sense for the District gov
ernment to have to buy a new lion’s
cage, it obviously makes no sense for
the District to have to pay for the feed
ing and care of the lion.
All the same, the Smithsonian
Board of Regents is to be commended
for taking this Important first step, one
which certainly will be in the best inter
ests of the Zoo itself. The shameful
deficiencies and outmoded facilities of
this wonderful park have been fold too
many times to need repetition here. It
is the intention of the regents that,
starting next year, sufficient Federal
appropriations will be sought annually
to make the desirable improvements on
an orderly basis over a period of time.
As an initial stride in this direction, it
is especially important that the Zoo
WEDNESDAY, JULY 5,196 T
director, Dr. Theodore Reed, be giveh
the $50,000 he is seeking to prepare a
master plan for rehabilitating the park.
Troika and the U. N.
When the General Assembly meets
(Deo volente) for its 16th regular session
next fall, one of the big issues before
it will have to do with proposals for
drastic political and operating changes
in the present administrative structure
ofcthe United Nations. To put it mildly,
the issue threatens to generate a hot de
bate, and it conceivably could do irrep
arable harm to the world organization.
This danger, of course, stems pri
marily from Premier Khrushchev’s ap
parent determination—repeatedly ex
pressed by himself and his propagandists
throughout the past year—to get rid of
Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold
and replace the Secretary’s office with
a triumvirate made up of a “neutralist,”
a Westerner and a Communist. Clearly,
since each of these three would have
the power to veto anything and every
thing of substance, such an arrangement
would be an executive monstrosity
capable of reducing the U. N.—Assembly
and Security Council alike—to complete
. paralysis and uselessness in times of
international crisis.
Nevertheless, Mr. Khrushchev has
plainly indicated that he intends to keep
on demanding that Mr. Hammarskjold
and the U. N. Secretariat be swept away
to make room for this hydra-headed
paralyzer A-an organizational set-up so
inherently and so obviously unworkable
that the Kremlin’s growing insistence
upon it suggests that the Soviet Union,
for reasons best known to itself, is
seeking to destroy the United Nations
by reducing it to an absurdity. Nor have
the so-called “uncommitted” or “un
aligned” nations of Asia and Africa
been of much help in this matter. On
the contrary, their “compromise” pro
posal—which would retain the office
of Secretary General but still subject
it to the veto of three deputies, “neu
tralist,” Western or Communist—seems
quite as bad as Mr. Khrushchev’s, only
perhaps a bit less forthright, and much
more naive.
In these circumstances, It is good
that Mr. Hammarskjold, in a formal
commentary on a special study of the
subject, has once again emphasized that
he is unalterably opposed to the Soviet
effort to transform the U. N. into an
International political troika, with each
of the three horses at liberty to gallop
off, at whim, in any and all directions.
To be sure, he favors reorganizing
the secretariat in away that will enable
qualified Communists and “neutralists”
to move into more administrative jobs
than they have now, but he has left no
room for doubt that he will defend his
office against all Red efforts to destroy
its Independence, impartiality and
objectivity.
In all of this, it need hardly be
z added, the Secretary General can count
upon the strong support of the United
States and the West in general. And he
can rely, too, on those nations of Asia
and Africa that have kept their eyes
open and see clearly, despite the Krem
lin’s efforts to fog up everything, how
the troika principle, if adopted, could
bury the U. N. and their own hopes
with it.
Change in Korea
In resigning both as Premier and as
head of the military junta that seized
• power in South Korea little more than a
month ago, 36-year-old Lieutenant Gen
eral Chang Do-young appears to have
caved in under pressures demanding
stronger leadership. At any rate, al
though the situation remains rather
obscure, that is the way his sudden
departure from political eminence is
» being generally interpreted in Seoul.
The new Premier is Defense Min
ister Song Yo-chan, 43, who served with
distinction as army chief of staff during
the regime of ousted President Syngman
Rhee, and who is a retired lieutenant
general. Apparently, again according
to reports from Seoul, he is widely re
spected among his countrymen for his
toughness, his integrity and his deter
mination to stand fast against commu
nism and promote far-reaching polit
ical and economic reforms in South
Korea.
Important as his post may be, how
ever, Premier Song is subordinate to
the man who has replaced General
Chang as chairman of the junta. This
man is Major General Pak Chung-hi,
aged 44. Actually, he is said to have
been the chief organizer of the May
coup and the real power behind the
scenes ever since, with Chang’s regime
serving merely as a kind of front for
him. In any case, he now has assumed
the top role in South Korea, with em
phasis on promises to “march forward”
with “reconstruction of the national
economy and establishment of social
morals.”
Incidentally, it should be noted, as
the Associated Press has reported, that
General Pak has been linked in the
past with the Reds. But his role in that
sense seems to have been shortlived. In
the AP’s words, he “was actually under
death sentence at one time after a
court-martial convicted him of forming
a Communist apparatus in the South
Korean army.” But he “won forgiveness
by turning over enough information to
enable the army to purge most of its
Communists at the start of the Korean
conflict.” And he “has had an exemplary
record since.”
Another reassuring fact is that
General Pak has long had a close and
friendly relationship with General Song,
who is now Premier and whose oppo
sition to the Communists seems uncom
promising. In the circumstances, the
United States and the free world as a
whole have ground for confidence that
the latest political change in Seoul will
tend to strengthen, rather than weaken,
South Korea’s resistance to Red total
itarianism.

LETTERS TO THE STAR
'Propaganda' Material'
Rather than being even
slightly outraged by the Tor
caso decision I looked upon
it as a possible source of
propaganda advantage. A
day or two before or after
the Torcaso decision it was
reported that a number of
Hungarian priests had been
arrested and will probably be
severely punished because
they dared express political
ideas. Would it not be to our
advantage if we could pub
lish to the world that the
highest court in our land
had honored its obligation to
protect an ordinary citizen
in his right to insist that
our country’s Government be
carried on in accordance
with our Constitution, even
a not very well understood
part of our Constitution? By
contrast Russian - dominated
countries appear to have no
Constitution to appeal to.
Repression comes easily to
the relatively small clique
who rule countries such as
Hungary.
Charles Ij. Stout.
Unlicensed Guns
The Second Amendment
stipulates: “A well-regulated
militia being necessary to
the security of a free State,
the right of the people to
keep and bear arms shall
not be Infringed.” That re
fers to a well-regulated mi
litia. It is not blanket au
thority for everybody to
maintain a private arsenal.
Registering guns does not
nullify anybody’s right to
bear arms. Congress has
passed laws restricting the
possession of sawed-off shot
guns, for instance. Congress
has prohibited shipment of
guns and ammunition
through the mail. Many
States require the registra
tion of guns and permits to
carry them. These laws have
not been declared unconsti
tutional nor have they nulli
fied the right to possess
guns.
Regarding automobile reg
istration, if raising money to
build roads was the primary
consideration it could be
done by levying taxes with
out the registration feature.
Taxes are paid on all kinds
of personal property. It is
not necessary to register your
refrigerator or to get a li
cense to operate your wash
ing machine. The fee paid
for a driver’s license does
not cover much more than
expenses of administering
the program. I believe the
analogy I made is still valid.
William Plampin.
Capital Punishment
It has been pointed out
that the four hapless clients
of the bogus lawyer who are
now sitting out their days in
death row pose a nice legal
problem. It might also be
said that they pose a nice
moral problem for us in
whose name the District of
Columbia is prepared to kill
them. Their lawyer lacked
credentials: but who gave
proper credentials to judge
and jury and prosecutor to
send these men to their
deaths? The answer is simple
—we, the people did. We who
are too bored, or callous, or
faint of heart to tackle the
tough problems of crime and
punishment and rehabilita
tion, say that such and such
men, in certain situations,
can kill a token few, prefer
ably Negroes.
Let us make a beginning,
in this increasingly dehu
manized world, in affirming
our sense of the sanctity of
human life, with these four
wretched men. Let us abol
ish capital punishment here
in the Nation's Capital. As
members of the Socialist
Party - Social Democratic
Federation, which has long
advocated the abolition of
capital punishment, we call
on the District Commissioners
to use all their powers to
rid the District of Columbia
of this archaic, unjust, dis
criminatory and useless pun
ishment, the death penalty.

Clumsy Gesture?
Would someone please tell
me what international un
derstanding could possibly
come from our Vice Presi
dent’s good-will gesture to
ward a Pakistani camel
driver? The concept of peo
ple-to-people programs is
excellent, but once more sin
cerity defies all common
sense. Again we try to bridge
the vast chasm between our
highly technical civilization
and a simple, rudimentary
one by throwing out a pon
toon bridge of row boats.
Certainly Vice President
Johnson’s dramatic gesture
was sincere. It was also awk
ward and ill-considered. And
now it appears that every
one at the top of our society
wanted to get into a demon
stration of friendship at the
grass-roots level without the
slightest thought that our
notions of grass-roots and
those abroad are poles apart.
The whole matter could be
made to appear a propa
ganda stunt, even if this was
not the intention.
Despite thousands of globe
trotting Americans and offi
cial representatives abroad,
one might well wonder if we
are really capable of pene
trating the ethos of a foreign
people. Our apparent lack
of perception seems to be
furthered by a kind of self
indoctrinated provincialism,
and the higher the echelon
of officialdom, the more evi
dent this lack appears.

Good Reporting
The Brightwood Commun
ity Association would like to
take this opportunity to com
mend The Star for its out
standing contribution to the
Washington community in
reporting the underhanded
attempt to discredit the
Washington public school
system. The exposure of the
photographers and the mo
tives of the lawmaker who
hired them to photograph
fraudulent scenes of racial
unrest did much to bring to
light the efforts of many
groups to foil our attempts
at Integration.
It is the policy of our as
sociation to make certain that
such service does not go un
recognized. Your alert, timely
and comprehensive coverage
of the story exemplifies the
high ideals upon which your
paper was founded. Freedom
of the press is truly a great
right when placed in the
hands of an organization
such as yours. We earnestly
hope that you will continue
unbiased reporting.

Big Corporations
Recently there has been a
good deal of unfavorable
publicity in the press con- j
cerning the big, evil corpora
tions and their so-called
strangle-hold on the Ameri
can economy.
The administration has
put them in a bad light, and
there’s even been some talk
of breaking up giant com
panies such as General Elec
tric, etc. However, before we
go too far in condemning or
cutting up these big corpora
tions, we ought to examine
our relative position univer
sally, not only with respect
to our morals, where there
is room for improvement, but
compare our economic and
military position as well.
Most of us will agree that
with our high standard of
living, we’re pretty well off.
All the men representing Big
Business are not angels, but
it cannot be denied that Big
Business made a major con
tribution in the victory of
the last two wars, and is
now daily helping this Nation
hold down or acquire the No.

Let’s keep ’em big.

Thanks Blood Donors
It is heartwarming to note
that because of the most
outstanding and generous re
sponse by Red Cross blood
donors during the past fiscal
year the District of Colum
bia Chapter of the American
- Red Cross, at noon on June
29, was able to announce
that its blood collection
quota of 44,054 pints of blood
had been reached. This ex
cellent response on the part
of the volunteer donors and
the hard work of the hun
dreds of volunteer bold re
cruiters, has meant that
blood has been available for
the patients in our hospitals
throughout the year.
As we come to the close of
our fiscal year, I would like
to express, on behalf of the
Red Cross, our grateful ap
preciation to the thousands of
volunteer donors and volun
teer recruiters whose dona
tions and hard work made
this wonderful record possible.
We begin our new year
with every confidence that
the continuing job of col
lecting our quota of blood,
especially during the vacation
months, will be made easier
because of the loyal support
and hard work of our donors
and recruiters.

Indorses Duncan
How about merit? John
B. Duncan’s record in Gov
ernment alone surely should
qualify him as a Commis
sioner in our great city. He
has been a Government em
ploye for 28 years.
His record of civic interest
for many years, his princi
ples and integrity, not to
mention a reputation that is
beyond reproach, all add to
his academic qualifications:
these are the standards upon •
which our Government places
promotions. These are the
merits which we claim one
of high office should have.
I am sure that we have
found in Mr. Duncan the
qualifications for a promo
tion as a Commissioner for
the District.

Disillusioned
I have been a Democrat
all my life. I supported and
would have voted for JFK
had I not been a non-United
States citizen by reason of
residence in Washington.
The President's philoso
phies, as expressed in his
campaign speeches, in the
“Great Debates” and in his
inauguration speech, plus
his general demeanor and ap
parent courage and aggres
siveness when the chips were
not down, inspired great hope
in the breasts of many that
at last we had elected a
courageous leader!
I regret to state that I and
all those with whom I have
discussed the subject feel that
our champion, now that he
is in the ring, has gone
“chicken”. This is evidenced
by the Cuban fiasco and its
aftermath, the tractors-for
prisoners deal, and the state
ment by Dean Rusk that the
United States is willing to
negotiate on Berlin. Numerous
other incidents that add up to
lack of courage, confusion, or
both, could be cited.
It appears that Mr. Ken
nedy is trying to play it safe
from all angles with the view
to re-election. Let him and
his advisers not forget that
if the present course is fol
lowed too long the office of
President might not exist
when the next election time
comes around. Instead, it is
highly probable that Nikita
Khrushchev will be looking
for candidates for Commis
sar.

THE PASSING SCENE
By RALPH McGILL
Modern Berlin Is
There is in all history no
city-story comparable with
that of Berlin. It covers an
area as large as the vast
complex of Los Angeles.
About 70 per cent of its
buildings were destroyed by
World War H’s bombs and
shells.
When Allied Western
troops entered it, it was a
smoking, stinking pile of rub
ble and huts. The stench was
provided by dead bodies un
der the ruins and by the
wreckage of sewers and all
sanitation systems.
The Russians had been
there for 10 weeks. They had
done a thorough job of re
moving what the demolition
of war had missed. They took
away machines from the fac
tories, equipment from the
power stations, the undam
aged trolleys and under
ground trains, and most of
the buses.
So efficient was this So
viet ""liberation” of the phys
ical remains that an esti
mated 92 per cent of all tools
and machines were taken
from the larger plants. This
included, for example, 52
automatic, underground tele
phone exchanges, with a ca
pacity of 250,000 lines, and
most of the generators.
A further tribute to their
thoroughness was the fact
that they made a .careful
search sos, found and took
the blueprints, technical
drawings, formulas and all
other such information from
the files of the companies so
ravaged.
They kept what was needed
in their zone. The Americans,
British and French had the
job of supplying such equip
ment for their own areas.
The Break-Up Period
In this period the four
powers were admitting they
had co-operated to win the
war. The assumption was
there eventually would be a
peace treaty which would
produce one Germany—not
two. Hence, it did not then
seem important that Berlin
was wholly surrounded by
Soviet - occupied territory—
later to become East
Germany.
The Russians began to
have doubts in late 1945.
Municipal elections were
held. Social Democrats won
more than half the seats and
the majority was heavily
anti-Communist. Soon there
after the Soviets began to
withdraw their zone of Ber
lin from control of the
elected magistrates.
By 1947 the allied control
system had all but broken
VISTAS IN SCIENCE
By THOMAS R. HENRY
Man's Two Brains
Higher animals, including
man, have two brains. They
are almost, if not quite, in
dependent of each other.
Experiments demonstrat
ing this have been reported
by Dr. R. W. Sperry of Cali
fornia Institute of Tech
nology through the American
Association for the Advance
ment of Science.
Right and left halves of
the brain duplicate each
other in all essential func
tions and in all essential
areas such as those of vision,
hearing, touch and taste. In
the intact brain the two
halves are joined by various
nerve fiber systems. When
these are severed, however,
almost no difference can be
found in the ordinary behav
ior of an animal.
One half the brain seems
actually unaware of what the
other half is doing, or may
do. This can be demonstrated
in the field of vision, for ex
ample, by putting a patch
over one eye and training an
animal to do various tasks
requiring visual stimuli. Then
the visual area in the cere
bral cortex on the side of
the unobstructed eye is surg
ically removed. The animal
no longer can make the re
sponses, or do the job, for
which it has been trained.
There apparently has been
no transfer from one side of
the brain to the other.
Transfer of Emotions
Regardless of severing of
the nerve connections be
tween two sides of the brain,
however, there appears to be
some transfer of emotions,
Dr. Sperry says.
“Incidental obs e r vations
made in the course of train
ing and testing,” says the re
port, “suggest that milder as
pects of emotional attitude
and temperament, like stub
bornness and sulkiness, can
be confined to one side. It
might be possible to make
one of the separated hemi
spheres neurotic and leave the
other normal. Some animals
act normally fearful or fero
cious when using the eye con
nected with the intact hemi
sphere. but promptly become
more tame, placid and gen
erally less touchy when the
lesion hemisphere is made
dominant by switching the
visual occluder to the other
eye.”

There are bat fishermen.
These flying mammals live
almost exclusively on flsh ,
which they locate by means
of an inbuilt, air-borne sonar
system.
This has been reported by
Dr. J. J. G. McCue of Massa
chusetts Tech through the i
Office of Naval Research
which has sponsored his in- <
vestigations. Because of evi- 1
dence that the in-built bat :
sonar systems are extremely ;
effective, the principles that
a Historic Saga
down. It did break in March
of 1948 when Marshal So
kolovsky, acting on orders
from Moscow, where there
was vast irritation because
the three Allied powers were
going ahead with rehabilita
tion plans for their zones,
walked out of the four-power
council meeting.
There was a deadlock of
inaction until June 20. On
that day the brilliant cur
rency reform plan went into
effect for West Germany.
(Gen. Lucius D. Clay’s com
petent administration as
military governor has been
largely obscured by subse
quent events.) In an effort
to defeat this program, the
Russians halted all road, rail
and barge movement into the
city, cutting off coal, food
and other supplies.
The Great Airlift
Gen. Clay replied with the
now legendary airlift. It be
gan on June 26, 1948. It was
believed the Soviets shortly
would lift the barriers. They
did not. The airlift continued
for 462 days. It was, in every
respect, a tremendous accom
plishment. Two-and-a-half
million people had been kept
alive by the delivery of
2,343,301 tons of food and
supplies with the completion
of a massive total of 277,264
aircraft flights.
Thisfcaught the imagina
tion of the world. It pro
duced, too, a grudging affec
tion for the Berliners. They
existed on a slim diet of
canned meats, powdered eggs
and dried vegetables. The
supply of coal was meager.
Electric current was on a
total of four hours in each
24. But they lasted it out.
From that time on there
have been two Berlins—West
and East.
The reconstruction of West
Berlin did not really get
going in full measure until
about 1950. Today it is again
a prosperous, glittering city.
Refugees pour into it from
the East and after screening
are flown out into West
Germany. It provides a vivid
contrast with the drabness of
East Berlin. It is this which
offends. But it also is Berlin
which prevents an expansion
of total Communist control
and the clear establishment
of two Germanys.
The West’s problem is
whether to hold to what
seems like a fading possibil
ity—that there can again be
one Germany without a war
to make it so—or to find a
way to hold its area of Berlin
while accepting an East
Germany.

ing studied by Massachu
setts Tech scientists.
One of the very few bats
that fish for a living, says
Dr. McCue, is the noctilio
perorinus which inhabits
parts of the Caribbean area.
It catches fish by gaffing
them with well developed
claws.
Fear Full Moon
“This he does,” says the
report, “by flying low over
the water, dipping his feet
from time to time, and drag
ging them for distances of
a few inches to a few feet.
Some fraction of the time
this dipping results in pull
ing out a fish.”
The bats, Dr. McCue says,
avoid fishing on nights with
a full moon because they
themselves may be snatched
by much larger fish leaping
out of the water. On other
nights they appear shortly
after dusk.
The experiments to date,
says the report, have given
a clear Indication that the
bats locate their victims in
the water by means of sonar
pulses which they send out.
They may, however, simply
detect ripples in the water
made by fish swimming be
low the surface, rather than
the actual fish themselves.
Most of the observations to
date have been carried out
in the Canal Zone.

Q. Please describe the hag
fish.—l. W.
A. This salt - water fish
(Myxine glutinosa) has been
described as “a slimy, bone
less, eel-like creature without
eyes.” It is related to the
lamprey, ranges up to some
30 inches in length, is a car
rioneater and also parasitic.
Some kinds of hagfish are
found in deep water; others
prefer the soft mud of bays.
The mouth-end of the hag
fish has no jaws. The round
mouth is surrounded by ten
tacles which are used as feel
lers; the tongue is studded
with horny teeth, which are
used to bore into the bodies
of large fish. When caught,
the creature pours out slime
from the abdominal mucous
sacs along its sides.
Q. In investments, what
are “defensive” stocks?—A. A.
A. This term refers to
stocks which ordinarily do
not suffer as seriously as the
market in general in a time
of economic recession. They
are conservative stocks, which
give a high degree of prin
cipal safety and assured
though moderate income.
Bank, utility, food company

This writer road a very interest
ing and informative article in the
July issue of N C. Wildlife concern
ing the reason for the Second
Amendment to the United States
Constitution which says. ""A well
Regulated Militia being necessary
to the security of a free State, the
right of the people to keep and
bear arms shall not be infringed
Citizens, well trained in the use
of firearms for the sport of hunting,
have throughout History turned in
to good citizen-soldiers and no dic
tatorship has ever been imposed
on a people having the right to
bear arms More rifle practice by
civilians, especially young people,
is necessary to improve our na
tional defense.” Before reading the
article, I had never approved the
sport of hunting, believing it cruel
for men to go out shooting small
animals and birds, and thinking it
very lirimitive for them to take
pleasure in it. And it is terrible
to think that the good marksman
ship acquired in this sport has
been used to kill human beings
and will, no doubt, be used for
the same purpose in the future. The
article is well worth serious con
sideration by all American citizens,
and I agree with the author, Jim
Lee, both men and women should
be well trained in the use of fire
arms in preparation to take up
arms in defense of our country
should the need arise, and it seems
he need is rising.

YMBC PRESIDENT
Ocean Springs site
may be reactivated
Development of Magnolia
State Park as a Coast play
ground is being considered.
O. A. Latil of Ocean Springs,
state parks commissioner, ask
ed county supervisors Tuesday
for “support and suggestions”
in reactivating the park.
Latil said, “we don't have
the money to do the work but
we’re not asking the county
for funds. We just want to
know that we have your sup
port and see if you have any
suggestions.
""There is a terrific need
for recreational facilities in
this area. The site near
Ocean Springs is ideal. All
we need is a plan and financ
ing,"" he said.
Supervisor president A. P.
Moran told Latil a master plan
for development of the park
probably could be obtained
from federal files through leg
islators.
‘That land is worth $1000
per acre and something should
be done about it,” Moran said.
The county purchased 250
acres for $25,000 about 25 years
ago, he said.
Recently 50 acres were
made available for use by
4H clubs of the state. The
remaining 200 acres is now
slate-owned. ""We didn't real
ize one cent out of the trans
action,"" the supervisor said.
Latil said the governor will
“go along with us in the de
velopment of the park.” How
ever, no funds for Magnolia
development were included in
the present budget, he added.
“We will have to take it one
step at a time until a new bud
get is approved. We hope to
get more funds then,” he said.
Final rile held
for county native
Ernest Mallette
Final rites were held Thurs
day for Ernest Mallette, 77,
Jackson County native, who
died Wednesday at the home
of his daughter in Atmore,
Ala.
He was born in Vancleave,
lived most of his life in Ocean
Springs.
Services were conducted
at 3 p.m- Thursday from Re
organized Church of Jesus
Christ Latter Day Saints in
Vancleave. The Rev. Clyde
Parrish officiated. Interment
was in the church cemetery.
Survivors include two dau
ghters, Mrs. Cora Mae Walr
drop, Atmore, and Mrs. Mar
tha Phillips, Okinawa; two
brothers, James K., Lucedale,
and Eugene, Gulfport; a sister,
Mrs. Ida Holland, Saucier; five
grandchildren and one great
grandchild.

Plan installation
of therapy facility
at county hospital
A deep therapy department
will be installed at Singing
River Hospital.
Lester Tuck, hospital admin
stratur, presented two propos
als to county supervisors Tues
day. One was for installation of
a machine now in storage a
the hospital. The second was
for installation of a new ma
chine.
Supervisors approved the
new-machine plan.
Tuck said figures showed
the machine installed would
cost in local funds less than
$200 more than installation
of the old because of federal
funds available for the new
equipment.
Total cost for the new ma
chine installed is $46,000. Cost
for installation of the old
would be $42,526.
Figures on the new machine
installation are:
Construction cost, $30,990;
equipment, $12,500; architect
fee, $1859, and site survey,
$650, for a $46,000 total.
P’inancing of the new-equip
ment installation would be:
Federal funds, $30,666; lo
cal funds, $14,334, and cash
for old machine, $1000 for a
$46,000 total.
Old machines figures are:
Construction cost, $38,090;
equipment (installation cost),
$1500; architect fee, $2285, and
site survey, $650, for a total of
$42,526.
Financing of the old-ma
chine installation would be fed
eral funds. $28,350, and local
funds, $14,175, for a $42,526
total.
Tuck said funds are avail
able from donations to the
hospital, $7000 of which
came from Ingalls.
The old instrument was do
nated by Singing River Hospit
al radiologist Dr. Sam Levi,
Tuck said.

Issue is settled,
so state returns
come in slowly
Mississippi voters gave a
60-1 vote of approval to the
two constitutional amend
ments Tuesday.
The legislature will meet
Oct. 17 to put into law the
changes that will bring a
$125-million Standard Oil
refinery to Pascagoula.
So overwhelming was the
vote in favor of the amend
ments, reported the Associated
Press, that many counties did
not bother to compile totals
and the returns trickled in
slowly.
An AP tabulation Thursday
showed proposal No. 1 on lib
eralizing county tax exemp
tions led 67,462 to 1105, while
proposal No. 2 on school lands
use led 64,348 to 1237.
With the amendments assur
ed, Gov. Ross Barnett called a
special session for Oct. 17 to
write laws under the new con
stitutional changes to put the
changes into effect.
Barnett said he would limit
the session to implementing
the changes and would not
open the door to reapportion
ment, local bills or redrawing
lines for the congressional dis
tricts necessitated by the loss
of a representative in the wake
of the 1960 census.
The popular support given
the two amendment proposals
rivaled the vote given them in
the legislature, where one
passed both houses unanimous
ly and the other had only one i
dissenting vote in the House. j
The first amendment would
extend from five to 10 years
the length of time counties
may grant property tax ex
emptions to new or expanded
industries. Cities may now
grant 10-year exemptions.
The second amendment
would permit the sale or 99

ff A Weekly staffer was plagued
all winter by mysterious throat

him to the hospital for throat x

there was nothing amiss with the

Dabbs Discusses
Racial Conflict
Bv WAI TER PHILLIPS
Understanding between the rac
es in the light of segregation in
the South will afford the South's
contribution to the nation and to
the world, according to James
Mcßride Dabbs M r Dab bs, a
South Carolinan, spoke to mem
bers of the Chapel Hill Fellow
ship for School Integration Thurs
day night in the First Baptist
Church,
In his talk, “Who Speaks for
South,” he stressed that the
white Southerner feels he is a
Southerner, but that “ever since
the Civil War when the South was
forced back into the Union, the
South and the Southerner have
been hanging onto the nation.
“Negroes want to get out of
the South.” he said, ""but I don't
think they're involved in this
psychological excitement, an d
therefore they're not so confus
ed
""The white Southerner tends to
identify himself by what he's
against, and this is unfortunate.
He’s'been led into defensive ac
tion because of this chip on his
shoulder,” he continued.
Defining this idea of defense
as a ""desire to contribute,” he
said it was unfortunate that the
South did not say much alxuit
this.
“What the South needs is a vis
ion of what is here now and what
is coming,” he continued. ""The
seed is here.”
He then listed his two “partial
visions” of the South—segrega
tion and industrialization—term
ed segregation ""our way of life
. . . pathetic and a nightmare.
""This is passing—fading—y e t
Southerners are still trying to
sell it. But deeper pathos arises
from Southerners who have soon
nothing hut segregation and try
to sell it to the North ”
He labeled his second vision,
industrialization, ""a vision of the
Chamber of Commerce,” and
said he failed to see how the
South's energies could he turned
loose barring what he called ""un
conscious absorption""
""It would not be a contribu
tion,” he explained. ""We couldn’t

As If There Had Been A Death In The Family
By J. A. C. DUNN
The UNC players arrived at
Kenan Field House at It 3fl Sat
urday morning. They were not
talkative They stood in line
at the equipment issue window
and went to their benches in the
dressing room and slowly, al
most casually, dressed in game
pants and jerseys, without pads.
Some went into the treatment
room and had ankles, wrists,
hands, elbows padded and taped.
Trainer John Lacey and his as
sistants worked with quiet ef
ficewy. There wasn't anything
to say. so nobody tried to say it-
There was a telegram on the
bulletin board outside Lite equip
ment room:

false. They would have brought
us to industrialization ”
Then giving what he said was
his vision of the South, Mr.
Dabbs ""suggested"" that it was
simply a fart that made the
South distinctive because, he
said, “The South is white and
Negro together.
""We have lived together for
several hundred years, and each
race has been a help to the other
and a burden to the other. You
don't have to agree, but tonight
all of you here, whites and Ne.
grocs. are making this vision
take form by showing that you
accept each other.”
Speaking in what he called bas
ic terms, he said the Negro is a
true Southerner even though it
may be hard for many whites to
take
""To be a Southerner in the
Deep South is to have status. And
when you analyze what the Ne
groes are doing, they're South
erners.""
He listed three characteristics
of the young Negroes: courage,
new action born out of defeat and
religion.
Terming courage “a vaunted
word of the South more often at
a dead level than a marching
plume."" he was unable to say ex
actly how it came to lie instilled
in the Negro.
""They learned a sense of free,
dom by reading Patrick Henry's
speech. Bui it doesn't matter
who the man was What you have
is the old courage ot Iho South
with a new cutting edge ""
He said whites had plenty of
courage hut that it was badly
diffused.
""The whites who were defeat
ed by the Union have learned
hesitancy, and this is a part of
wisdom."" He may fail, and he
has failed
""And the Negroes who were
still unwillingly held in segrega
tion have slimmed up their de
feat in their spirituals. They trust
in God and hope for a better day.
""We quarrel with the yankecs,
and we’ll quarrel until 4 am.
about states' rights but never
once mention human rights.”
Turning to religion, he said,
“Negroes are taking the old reli
gion and making something new

Mr Coxhead’s continual re

than last year, brought a good re

By LEON ROOKE

Os the more than 50,000 foreign
students now studying at Ameri
can institutions of higher learn
ing 165 arc currently enrolled at
the University here.
Eleven ranking educators—af
ter a study of five months—told
the American Association of Land

not know what is expected of
them in thoir relationship with

A representative body of the
165 foreign students studying at
the University disputed the truth
of that report—at least insofar as
UNC is concerned.
Lebanese, Japanese, Lafin A

dents from India all echoed a
similar refrain: ”1 feel right at

“I feel 1 know the American
people and am very much at

said. “Very friendly,"" an indus

‘Casualties* In Disaster Drill
Gravely Stages
A Disaster Drill
The lobby of Gravely Sanator
ium is normally a peaceful, pleas
ant place. There are clean stone
tile floors and curtains at the
windows and ashtrays placed
conveniently to leather-covered
easy chairs. It is a waiting room
in which a person cart feel com
fortably anonymous.
But Friday afternoon it would
have turned your stomach
AH over the clean stone tiles
lay wounded young men, pale,
writhing, moaning now and then.
A jagged splinter of jawbone was
gashed through a blood smeared
cheek. The end of a shin poked
horribly through torn flesh and
trousers. One man lay gasping
with a gaping hole in his abdo
men Another man’s crew cut
was matted with congealing
blood, gno crouched, trembling,
against a wall, shrinking away
from the nurse who tried to take
his pulse, slack-mouthed and va
cant-eyed in mental shock. There
were others
They looked like the victims of
an explosion in a glass factory
As a matter of fact, that might
have l>een just the disaster that
brought them there, because
Gravely Sanatorium held its
quarterly disaster drill Friday.
It came off very well.
Just after lunch twelve student
nurses went to work making up
""wounds” on twelve volunteers
from the University NKOTC Bat
tulion. The blood and flesh came
from a theatrical supply house.
The 1 tones came from the Sana
torium kitchen The raw intes
tines came from guinea pigs in
the Sanatorium’s research lab.
Faces were made deathly pale
with face powder. Symptoms, re
actions, and behavior were the
result of careful coaching by the
nurses.
The lobby was the triage (sort
ing) area A nurse and an in
terne were in attendance. 4jlu
dent nurses and Sanatorium per
sonnel stood around the scene
and watched. Sometimes they
giggled at a particularly realistic
groan
The men were labeled with dis.
aster tags, giving names, ad
dresses, ages, diagnoses of in
juries, treatments administered.
The man with the abdominal
wound was put aside to die—the
single interne could not afford to
spend time on a hopeless ease.
Sanatorium porters and orderlies
carried the victims to a treat
ment ward, one by one. The
nurse whisked from body to body,
helping, soothing, questioning
They groaned at her, happily.
The spectators giggled. The nurse
By 12:30 all the players were
back in the dressing room, put
ting on pads and shoes. The
room was filled with the clack of
cleats on concrete, and there was
an atmosphere of purposeful ac
tivity. But there still wasn't much
talk It was like a company of
paratroopers suiting up for a
combat jump.
Dr. Warner Wells arrived,
dressed in corduroy R the play
ers had been paratroopers. Dr.
Wells would have been the only
man who looked as if he knew
he was coming back alive.
The last player finished dress
ing. and they all sat lined up on
the benches, watching. Outside,
the managers were loading equip
ment on the busses.
‘‘Let's go,” said Coach Hickey.

tried to help a man with a
smashed forearm to his feet, but
he fell back to the floor again,
bumping his head.
“N o w he's got a fractured
skull."" said the nurse, giggling
herself
The mental shock patient was
taken to a room by himself,
shuddering and stumbling. Some
were given simulated tetanus
shots. Others were splinted,
swabbed, bandaged The wounds
were extremely realistic. The
only thing wrong with them was
that the blood didn’t run.

“How does it feel to be dead?”
said an amused bystander.
Oh, it’s fun,” said the corpse
wryly.
The quarterly disaster drills
are part of the criteria on the
basis of which the Sanatorium is
accredited by the Joint Commis
sion on Accreditation of Hospit
als The Commission, formed by
representatives from four Amer
ican hospital and medical asso
ciations, examines hospitals on
request and accredits them if
they meet certain standards of
operation The Commission s cer
tificate of accreditation hangs
prominently in the Sanatorium’s
lobby
“All you have to do is have a
disaster plan of some sort,"" said
Russell Chambers, director of the
Sanatorium. “S om e hospitals
drew up a plan and then filed it
away and never did anything a
bout it But we have disaster
drills and fire drills four limes a
year I’m sure a fire drill would
go off like clockwork here. This
disaster drill was quite success
ful, too. The object is not to
train specific people to do speci
fic things in a disaster situation,
but to get the staff thinking a
hout what they ought to do, how
they should be organized. If we
can get them thinking almut this,
then we consider ourselves to
have been successful.""
One of the Sanatorium's func
tions in the event of a disaster
would lie to keep a steady stream
of patients moving through the

Power Line
Conference
Is Tuesday
Aldermen Seek
To Negotiate
A conference on the proposed
Duke Power line through the
Morgan Creek residential area
will be held Tuesday at I p.m. ia
the Town Hall.
The conference will be between
the Town, represented by Mayor
Sandy McClamroch and the
Board of Aldermen, and Dote
Power Co., represented by at
torney w I. Ward and other
Power Company representatives.
The object of the conference is
not specific, except that the town
is interested in finding if a mere
satisfactory route than the one
presently planned by Duke Power
can be found for the power line.
At last week's meeting of the
Aldermen a motion to amend the
zoning ordinance, giving control
of power transmission line con
struction to the town, died for
lack of a second.
In place of the amendment a
resolution was adopted, calling
for no action on the power line
until the Aldermen had negotiat- j
ed with Duke Power The resolu- a
tion was presented by Alderman \
Paul Wager.
The resolution said Duke Pow
er had chosen its power line
route in an ""arbitrary manner,”
and mentioned the “disfiguring
effect of a power line” and the
possibility that “an alternate
route could be selected which
would have a less deleterious ef
fect on the appearance and or
derly development of a pleasant
countryside,” namely the Mor
gan Creek area.
Morgan Creek property own
ers have opposed the power line
since its initial proposal some
weeks ago. claiming their pro
perty values would be lowered.
The resolution maintained that
the Board could “properly con
cern itself with the location and
character of public as well as
private structures and devstap.
ments” and resolved that ‘this
Board go on record hi support
of a restudy of alternate routes
for the high tension line . I .**
Mr McClamroch said yester
day that the Board had no spe
cific proposal to make to Duke
Power Co., and that the object of
the conference was to inform the
Board more fully of what Duke
Power has done so far. and more
specifically what it plans to do
about the power line.
The meeting will be open to the
public.

Let's Hunt Safely
BEARING ARMS

The White-tailed Deer, Delaware's only big game animal, is increasing in
numbers in our state as it is all across our country. Paradoxically, the white
tailed is multiplying almost within shouting distance of expanding suburban
developments. In spite of our heavy population, Delaware has the enviable
record of no fatalities during the seven shot-gun seasons for taking any deer.
Since Delaware is about as hilly as a pool table, the short-range shotgun
and rifled slug (also the pumpkin ball) is the legal weapon for the hunt. How
ever, never sell short the killing power of the rifled slug at 50 or 75 y'ards, for
it is a dependable big game weapon capable of penetrating a pine at least eight
inches. Fact is, at close range it is superior to a high-powered bullet. It is
likely to be deflected by heavy underbrush.
Delaware hunters will probably bring down about 600 ""white-tails"" in prime
condition during the eighth shotgun season on January 12 and 13. 1962. Hunters
are urged to practice safe handling of firearms. Do your share in keeping Dela
ware's deer season fatality-free.

j together for 18 years with their guns always ready to fire.
Never climb a tree or fence or jump a ditch with a loaded gun.
If you
do fall check your barrel for mud or packed snow in it. An obstruction in the
balrel can cause the gun to explode in your face.
»*
""Never pull a gun toward you by the muzzle.""
""Be sure of your target before you pull the trigger."" Know the identifying
features of the game you intend to hunt. A hunter's white handkerchief has
been mistaken for a deer's tail.
Sometimes the first shot only stuns. Be sure the animal is dead.
In an extensive hunter-safety color study made in Massachusetts it was
found that fluorescent 'blaze orange' was the most consistently visible under all
conditions. Ordinary yellow has a tendency to be dangerous since it is fre
quently mistaken for white.
Hunters are urged to make safe gun handling the leading factor in their
conduct both in the field and at home. Hunting ranks way down in 17th place
in terms of accidents per 100,000 participants, following football, baseball,
horseback riding, skiing, boating, skating and swimming. It should be the con
of everyone to make hunting even a safer participant sport than it is.
The ""Right to Bear Arms"" has been a basic right of the American people.
Along with the privilege granted us in the Second Amendment goes a serious
responsibility to vigorously practice and preach all the rules of hunting safely.

GOPs Stage Big
Fund Raising Drive
Across Country
By Douglas Cornell
WASHINGTON M — Republi
cans across the nation poured out
cash for the party till last night
along with cries that Democrats
are grabbing for more power with
“profligate spending” and “po
litical fakery.”
The Republicans spent the
evening at 17 party get-togethers
in 17 cities, tied together for an
hour by closed circuit television.
This was the warm-up and kick
off for the congressional election
campaign of 1962.
The oratory at the parties fol
lowed the usual political pattern
of swinging away at the opposi
tion, upholding the GOP cause
with professions of confidence,
and holding up the party as the
great hope of the nation for get
ting sound, sensible, responsible
government.
This was the other side of the
record the Democrats played on
Jan. 20—the first anniversary of
the New Frontier — when they
staged a fund-raising banquet that
drew people to Washington from
over the country.
Gen. Dwight Eisenhower paced
the parade of Republican speak
ers. It was the former President
who accused the Democrats of
.profligate spending and “living
on a flood of I.O.U.’s” He and
other GOP oratorial talent said
the opposition is reaching for a
more powerful central govern
ment and controls.
It was Gov. Rockefeller, trying
for another term as Governor this
year and perhaps for the White
House in 1964, who set off the
heaviest blasts at President Ken
nedy and his administration.
Rockefeller accused Kennedy
of political fakery in the way the
President handled a proposal to
establish a federal Department of
Urban Affairs and to install
Housing Administrator Robert C. |
Weaver as the first Negro in the j
cabinet.
Sen. Barry Goldwater oi Ari
zona, a favorite of the conserva
tives for a shot at the Presidency,
got tn his licks. He contended that
leftwingers dominate the New
Frontier and that the GOP must
“lead the way to fiscal sanity and
responsibility.”
Former Vice President (Richard
Nixon was sidelined, in the Re
publican political doings by a
virus infection.
The rallies were staged to pump
pep and money into the GOP for
the oncoming electioneering. They
were dubbed R.S.V.P. affairs:
“Republicans Start Victory Pro
gram”
WEATHER OUTLOOK
Fair and colder. Low tonight
-20, high tomorrow -10. In the
last 24 hours: High of -6, low of
-20. Max. wind 17 mph from ENE.
Sunrise 0:39 am., sunset at 3:54
pm. Temps, a year ago today:
High of 17, low of -16. Extremes
on this date since 1907: High of
35 in 1945, low of -37 in 1910.

Plant For Processing
Fur Seal Skins Could
Handle Other Alaska Furs
JUNEAU Oft — An Alaska plant
for processing Pribilof Island
seal skins could also handle other
furs such as mink, otter and bea
ver, state Commissioner A. H.
ftomick said yesterday.
The establishment of a fur seal
processing plant in Alaska has
been under discussion since the
Department of the Interior can
celed the fur seal processing con
tract it had with Fouke Fur Co.
of St. Louis.
While Fouke has been the ex
clusive processor of Pribilof
Island seal skins for many years
under a contract with the Interior
Department, Romick said, the pro
cess is not a secret one, as has
been claimed.
Rep. Art Harris of Nikolski Vil
lage, told the committee that dur
ing the mid-40s, Sears Roebuck
& Co. almost won the fur seal
processing contract.
“Fouke retained the contract,
however, because their dye last
ed for about 10 more washings,
out of the some 500 washings to
which the skins were subjected,
than the Sears dye,” Harris said.
Dr. Fred Honsinger, state veter
inarian, said fur breeders in the
south 48 are running into an in
creasing problem trying to obtain
adequate feed, while in Alaska
potential feed is being wasted.
Honsinger said the waste ma
terial from salmon canning opera
tions would be a good source of
feed for such fur-bearing animals
as mink.
He also mentioned the carcasses
of fur seals, waste from reindeer
slaughtering operations knd sea
lions.
BLACK WHALES SIGHTED
MAMNELAND, Fla. UP> — Two
large black whales were sighted
just outside the breakers in the
Atlantic Ocoan off Marineland.
F. G. Wood Jr., curator of the
Marine Studios, identified them as
North Atlantic right whales—so
named because oldtime whalers
considered them the right kind
for whale oil.
He said the whales normally
migrate south in the winter but
rarely come close to shore.
One of those sighted yesterday
was about 50 to 60 feet long and
the other about 25 feet.
No Kisses Allowed . . .
VANCOUVER, B.C. UPl — Miss
America and Vancouver’s official
greeter swayed toward each other
for a light buss on the cheek at
the airport. It didn’t come off.
“Here now,” snapped chaperone
Angela Petesch, “there’ll be no
kisses.”
Blushed Miss America, Maria
Beale Fletcher of Asheville, N.C.:
“It was slightly embarrassing.”
“Really disappointing,” mur
mured alderman Frank Baker.
Grey-haired Miss Petesch re
marked that “kissing strangers is
not becoming for our Miss Amer
ica. It’s downright undignified.”
Miss America arrived yester
day for a two-day fashion show.
State Board Would
Be Budget Head of
Dept, of Education
JUNEAU UR — The House
Health, Welfare and Education
Committee today gave its bless
ings to a bill which would make
the State Board of Education the
administrative and budgetary head
of the Department of Education.
The bill was reported back to
the House with signed recom
mendations by eight of the nine
member bi-partisan committee
recommending passage. It was
sent along to the Rules Commit
tee to await placement on the
calendar.
Only one member, Rep. Segun- |
do Llorente, (D-Alakankuk), sign
ed “no recommendation.”
Under terms of the measure, the
Commissioner of Education would
be appointed by, and serve at the
pleasure of the Board of Educa
tion. His appointment would be
subject to approval of the gov
ernor, and confirmation by the
Legislature.
The Board would confirm the
programming actions of the Com
missioner. It also would have full
administrative, budgeting and fis
cal powers, but could delegate
those powers to the Commissioner.
The Commissioner would pre
pare the initial departmental
budget and submit it to the Board
for its review before the Board
transmits it to the Governor.
The bill was introduced earlj
in the session by two Democrats
—Rep. Bill Erwin and Gilbert
Jarvela.
It is almost identical to a meas
ure introduced last year by two
Republicans, Reps. Baggen and
Parsons.
At that time the proposal touch
ed off what was probably the
bitterest battle of the session.
Then, too, the Health, Welfare
and Education Committee gave it
unanimous endorsement.

Pioneer Road Program
Remains Firmly Fixed in
State Affairs Committee
JUNEAU (JPt — A bill which
would place the pioneer access
road program completely within
the Department of Public Works
remained firmly fixed in the State
Affairs Committee today despite
efforts of an “Ice Bloc” lawmaker
to bring it out for action.
But the move touched off an
airing of pioneer road problems,
and the recommendation that the
Commissioner of Natural Re
sources appear before the House
for further discussion.
The action came after Rep. Bob
Blodgett moved that his bill be
removed from the State Affairs
Committee. The motion lost on a
voice vote.
Then taking the floor on a point
of personal privilege, Blodgett
said the people of the Northwest
District were concerned over the
lack of pioneer roads.
“If there is any place in the
state where pioneer roads are
justified, it is in the trackless
northwest,” Blodgett said.
Chairman of the State Affairs
Committee Morgan Reed of Skag
way, said there had been many
requests for pioneer roads in
Southeast Alaska, too, which had
received “no allocation and no
consideration.”
“Even so ! don’t think we should
use an axe on. the administrators
t of this program,” Reed said.
“They have access to knowledge
on conditions throughout the
[ State—which we don’t.”

SURVIVAL COURSE . . .
PERTH AMBOY, N.J. UP) — The

lessons.
At the same time the board an
nounced an “individual and family
survival course” given free under
Civil Defense sponsorship.
With only six persons signing
up for survival, the school can
celled the course.
Amendment Would Give
Alaska Second Liability
In Payment of Bonds
JUNEAU (£) — A proposed
amendment to the finance and
taxation article of the State Con
stitution was introduced in the
Senate today.
The proposed amendment would
permit the State of Alaska to as
sume secondary liability for the
payment of general obligation
bonds issued by political subdi
visions for the purpose of con
structing of public schools, with
out ratification by the voters.
The measure was introduced by
Sens. A1 Owen, John Coghill,
George McNabb, Jack Weise, and
Eben Hopson.
As a proposed constitutional
amendment, the measure would
have to receive the approval of
a two-thirds majority of both the
House and the Senate and a ma
jority of the voters in the next
general election.

Sen. Harry Byrd
I Questions Research Dollars
I WASHINGTON UP) — Sen.
I Harry Byrd, (D-Va.), questioned
[ today whether the hundreds of
millions of government dollars
being poured into health research
are being spent wisely.
He cited as an example $1,291,
925 alloted for a study of “the
affectional relationship of the in
fant monkey to his mother.”
This sum for a continuing 6
year study is planned at a time
when the government “is operat
ing on deficits reaching billious
of dollars a year and running a
debt of $309 billion,” Byrd said
in a statement.
He added that there are many
other research projects he ques
tions and mentioned studies of
the biological control of snails by
shellcracker sunfish and of the
diving reflex and volume re
ceptors of the seal.
“It is difficult to be critical of
health research,” Byrd said, “but
it seems to me that much more
care should be exercised in the
expenditure of taxpayers’ money
even in this important area.”

„Consummarism""-ul
D-lui George Romney
Capitalistul George Romney,
care vrea să ajungă să fie
şi guvernator şi preşedinte al
S. U. A., este un om estetic.
El este de părere că cuvîntul
capitalism, ce înseamnă capita
lism, nu sună frumos. A des
coperit capitalistul Romney că
capitalismul este un cuvînt
prea urît de prea multă lume.
De aceea, fiind un capitalist în
zestrat cu o imaginaţie vie şi
încă creatoare, a propus acum
cîteva zile un alt cuvînt care să
i ia locul capitalismului. De
azi înainte, prin decretul capi
talismului Romney, capitalis
mul nu mai este capitalism, ci
CONSUMMARISM.

In Honor of Negro History Week
John Brown's Speech to the Court
Excerpts from John Brown’s
speech to the court at his
trial following the raid on
Harper’s Ferry.
• * *
IHAVL, may it please the
Court, a few words to say.
In the first place, 1 deny
everything but what I have
all along admitted —of a
design on my part to free the
slaves. I intended certainly
to have made a clean thing
of that matter, as 1 did last
winter, when 1 went into Mis
souri and there took slaves
without the snapping of a gun
on either side, moving them
through the country, and fi
nally leaving them in Cana
da.
I have another objection,
and that is that it is unjust
that I should suffer such a
penalty. Had 1 interfered in
the manner which I admit
and which 1 admit has been
fairly proved had 1 so in
terfered in behalf of any of
the rich, the powerful, the
intelligent, the so-called great
or in behalf of any of their
JOHN BROWN
friends, either father, moth
er, brother, sister, wife or
children, or any of that class,
and suffered and sacrificed
what I have in these interfer
ences, it would have been all
right, and every man in this
court would have deemed it
an act worthy of reward ra
ther than punishment.
INTERFERED IN
BEHALF OF POOR
This court acknowledges
too, as I suppose, the validity
of the law of God. I see a
book kissed which I suppose
to be the Bible, or at least
the New Testament, which
teaches me that all things
whatsoever I would that men
should do to me, 1 should do
even so to them. It teaches
me further to remember them
that are in bonds as bound by
them.
I endeavored to act up to
that instruction. 1 say 1 am
yet too young to understand
that God is any respecter of
persons.
I believe that to have in
terfered as I have done, as 1
have always freely admitted
1 have done, in behalf of His
despised pooT, is no wrong
but right.
Now, if it is deemed nec
essary that 1 would forfeit
my life for the furtherance of
the ends of justice, and min
gle my blood further with
the blood of my children and
with the blood of millions in
this slave country whose
rights are disregarded by
wicked, cruel and unjust en
actments, 1 say let it be done.
SEN. PAT McNAMARA
Military
Contractors
Feather Their
Own Nests
NEW YORK.—A fine sum
mary of the methods used by
military contractors to feather
their own nests at the expense
of the taxpayer is contained in
an aricle on “The Political
Economy of Armaments” by
Michael A. Lebowitz in t h e
winter issue of “Sanity,” a
student magazine devoted to
peace and disarmament, pub
lished at the University of Wis
consin, (P.O. Box 2015, Madi
son, 5, Wisconsin.)
Economist Lebowitz pulls
together the generally - un
heeded revelations and warn
ings of congressional hearings,
Sen. Douglas and others on the
profiteering of the munitions
merchants.
One interesting point is the
way these companies are able
to make the public pay even
for their advertising. For ex
ample, all advertising in trade
and technical journals is allow
ed as a cost of the military
manufacturer.
“A general idea as to the
extent of advertising dollars
this involves can be obtained
by looking at any single issue
of a trade or technical journal.
A spot check, for example, of
the April 1961 issue of the Sci
entific American revealed the
equivalent of 30 ad
vertisements on defense and
space items by major produc
ers. Under their cost-plus for
mula, the companies not only
are fully compensated for
their advertisements of their
own products, but also receive
a percentage profit on the cost
of the advertisements. Thus, a
corporation working on a cost
plus 10% basis can place a se
ries of ads for $lO,OOO, have
this included in its costs, and
receive $l,OOO additional on
its contract.”
And even the ads that ap
pear in popular outlets, such
as Life or the Saturday Even
ing Post, can be deducted as
a general business .expense and
will thus be subsidized 50%
by the U. S. taxpayers.
After reviewing in and e t a i 1
many other ways whereby the
armament manufacturers pile
up profits out of the bottomless
pit of militarism, he concludes
that, “For those currently
reaping the profits of defense
contracts, peace and disarma
ment pose a genuine threat . . .
Can we expect these groups to
use their power and influence
to work for a goverement po
sition which can lead to effec
tive disarmament?” The an
swer is fairly obvious at
least to students who want to
survive in an age of insanity.

52 Deportees to File Appeal Under
New Walter-McCarran Amendment
LOS ANGELES. Fifty
two persons under sentence of
deportation will reopen their
cases in the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals before April 26,
1962, as a result of the recent
ly passed Amendment to the
Walter-McCarran Law.
The new ruling curtails judi
cial review so that it is no
longer possible for persons ap
pealing a deportation order by
the Immigration and Naturali
zation Service to go to the
District Court.
The Second provision of the
Amendment provides that cas
es may not be taken from the
jurisdiction of the state in
which the order originated.
According to the third pro
vision of the Amendment, all
petitions for Judicial Review,
must be made within six
months of the issuance of the
final order, or within six
months of the issuance of the
firial order, or within s i x
months from the date of the
final enactment. It is on this
latter provision that the fifty
two cases must all be appeal
ed.
“We have spent $500,000
and twelve years fighting our
cases up to the Supreme Court,
and we will do it all over
again if necessary,” declares
the Rt. Rev. Walter Mitchell,
honorary Chairman, “Life as
a deportee is almost like being
in jail. They have never com
mitted any crime, but they
are sentenced to lifetime pa
role, and have to report reg
ularly to the Parole Officer, as
though they were criminals.
No matter what the outcome is,
we are prepared to go to Court
to fight for their freedom
again.""
Most of the Deportees were
brought to the United States
as young children, and were
wholly educated here. They
have been arrested for depor
tation under the 1952 Walter-
McCarran Act, because they
had been active in Unions and
in the Unemployment Move
ment of the thirties. Several
of them were born in Czarist
Russia, or other nations which
are now Socialist. These na
tions do not consider people
born during the old regime as
their nationals, and therefore,
will not accept them. Conse
quently, many of the depot
tees are literally “men without
a country ”, —with no possi
bility of being accepted by the
land of their birth.

Metro-Area
Virginia Daylight Time
Up for Senate Vote
By ALEX R. PRESTON
Star Staff Writer
RICHMOND, Mar. B.— Senate action on the Memorial Day-
Labor Day Daylight Saving Time bill was postponed until today
in the lace of two floor amendments which opponents claim
will wreck efforts to keep most of Vriginta on one time during
the summer.
One amendment was offered by Senator Blake T. Newton
of Westmoreland, allowing Prince William and Loudoun Coun-
ties, which adjoin the Tenth
Congressional District, to have
«lx months of DST.
The Senate General Laws
Committee, in reporting the
Governor’s bill for three months
of fast time—between Memorial
Day and Labor Day—has ex
empted the Tenth district, made
up of Arlington, Alexandria,
Fairfax and Falls Church, so
they could change their clocks
along with the District of
Columbia.
The committee also had al
lowed Bristol, which is half in
Virginia and half in Tennessee,
to remain on Standard Time
the entire year because Ten
nessee has mandatory Eastern
Standard Time.
Flurry of Debate
Senator Harry Stuart of Rus
sell County said the Senate
General Laws Committee, of
which he is chairman, in re
porting out the DST bill felt
if there are any amendments
other than those for the 10th
district and Bristol, ""we would
wind up with nothing at all.”
The second amendment that
stirred up a flurry of debate
was offered by Senator J. Hu
bert Wheeler of Lee County,
whose district runs along the
Tennessee-Kentucky border.
It would allow the three
counties west of Bristol to re-1
main on Standard Time the en
tire year. Mr. Wheeler said
mandatory DST would work a
hardship in his district because
many of his people are em
ployed in Kingsport, Tenn.
The Memorial Day - Labor
Day DST bill, with Bristol ex
empted, passed the House after
a test of strength between DST
and EST advocates in which
DST backers won, 48 to 45. The
Senate General Laws Commit
tee put on the six-month DST
amendment for the 10th dis
trict.
Confusion Feared
If the Senate passes the bill
with the Tenth District amend-:
ment alone or with Loudoun
and Prince William Counties
added, the bill will have to go
back to the House where EST
advocates are going to try to
.either kill the bill or amend it
to require Standard time the
entire year. Delegate Tom Frost
of Warrenton is the chief ad
vocate of Standard Time.
DST backers are now fearful,
with the General Assembly
facing adjournment Saturday,
of no legislation passing in the
11th hour deadlock, with the
result that the same confusion
would exist during the next
two years as prevailed last year
when Richmond moved its
clocks forward and a patch
work of towns, cities and
counties followed suit unoffi
cially.
In other developments:
The House gave final approv
al and sent to the Governor a
bill giving the 16th Judicial
Circuit at Alexandria, Fairfax
and Prince William Counties, a
fourth judge. The original bill
by Delegate James M. Thomson

THE EVENING STAR
Wothingtaa, D. C.
Thursday, March 8, 1962
of Alexandria called for two
extra judges.
A Democratic caucus tonight
is expected to nominate a
man for that office.
A bill by Delegate Harrison
Mann of Arlington revoking the
charter of the American Nazi
Party won unanimous approval
of the Senate General Laws
Committee. While the group
can incorporate under other
names, the bill bans the use of
the words “Nazi” or ""National
Socialist” in its title.
Would Repeal Charter
Mr. Mann said he wanted the
charter repealed because this
“despicable organization” con
tends its • operations are sanc
tioned by Virginia.
“This won’t stop the party
from operation, but it will take
away their right to operation
and use of the seal of Virginia
to indicate their operations
have the blessings of the
State,” Mr. Mann said.
A large number of House
members declined to vote on
approval of a resolution asking
Congress to change the vote
casting method by which the
President and Vice President of
the United States are elected.
The resolution passed, 39 to
124. with 37 delegates abstain
ing.
It seeks to count electoral
votes by congressional districts
rather than by whole State
units. For example, a State’s
electoral votes could be split
between two or more candi
dates instead of having the
entire State bloc of electoral
votes cast for the candidate
receiving the majority vote in
that State.
Former Republican Vice
President Richard M. Nixon
would have defeated President
Kennedy in the last election if
this system had been in force.!
Transportation
Agency Eyes Old
Bridge Piers
C. Darwin Stolzenbach, ad
ministrator of the National
Capital Transportation Agency,
has his eyes on the old Four
teenth street bridge.
Specifically, it’s the piers
that interest the administrator,
it was revealed in testimony be
fore a House Appropriations
subcommittee examining the
budgets of the Interior Depart
ment and related agencies.
Mr. Stolzenbach told the
chairman of the committee,
Representative Kirwan, Demo
crat of Ohio, that both the
Navy and the Army Engineers
had offered to conduct surveys
' of the ""feasibility of using the
piers” for rapid transit.
He said the study would de
termine whether the piers,
built many years ago,” are still
sound enough to be used for
our purposes.”

ALEXANDRIA WATERFRONT FLOODED

Prince Georges Issue
On Zoning Unsettled
Maryland planners yesterday postponed for two weeks a
decision that will shape the zoning future of Prince Georges
County.
The choice, as expressed by Planning Director Arthur
Stellhorn, is between a continuation of present “urban sprawl
of septic villages.” or a revamping of regulations to provide
for larger building lots.
A decision was held up pend
ing a discussion of septic prob
lems with county health au
thorities, but several commis
sioners from Prince Georges ex
pressed their disapproval of in
creasing lot minimums, on
grounds it would be “unfair”
to builders.
Present Provisions
The present ordinance per
mits 10 - thousand - square-foot
lots when public water and
sewers are available, or when
the county health officer is
satisfied that a septic tank is
practical.
Acording to the Maryland-
National Capital Park and
Planning Commission staff,
there is no pattern for develop
ment of these small lots in 60
per cent of Prince Georges
County, which falls in the rural
residential zone allowing such
lot provisions.
“The extension of a water
main is all that is required to
change a 20,000-foot lot into
two 10,000-foot ones, and it is
impossible to predict where it
may happen,” the staff report
said.
""As a result, subdivisions
spring up at unplanned loca
tions where it is difficult and
expensive for the county to pro-

vide services, such as roads and |

The planning staff termed
the situation “automatic zon
ing” and said it “endangers the |
whole purpose of the general
plan, which is now in the proc
ess of development.”
The technical staff urged
that 20,000 square feet be speci
fied as the minimum size for
lots, with certain exceptions.
John B. Lauer, commission
inember from Prince Georges,
’Suggested that a minimum of
15,000 square feet would be
more workable for builders.
Rise Held Unfair
Member John L. Pyles, an
other commission member, said
he has SIOO,OOO tied up in sub
divisions for which he has al
ready filed applications for
10,000-foot lots. Any increase
in minimums, he added, would
be ""unfair to builders.”
In other business, the com
mission denied a request for a,
100-acre airport on John Han
son highway and Church road,
near Belair. Although the air
port is now operating under a
permit for non-conforming use,!
yesterday’s action by the com
mission will not permit future 1
expansion.
The Prince Georges Planning i
Board expressed its determina
tion to back up provisions of
the Henson Creek watershed
plan, which is nearing com
pletion, by denying several re
zoning applications for apart
ments in the area.

into a ditch along State Route
197, just east of the Baltimore-
Washington parkway near
! Bowie, Md„ last night.
| Two of the victims were em
ployed as grooms at Bowie race
I track.
] Maryland State police said
the car had been traveling east
at a high rate of speed when
it drove off the north side of
the road while attempting to'
pass a car parked on the other
side.
The wreckage revealed that
: the speedometer was stuck at
65 miles an hour. Police said
[the speed limit there was 40
miles an hour.

Assembly Racing Time
On Bills in Maryland
By t Star Staff Wrltet
ANNAPOLIS, Mar. 8 —The
Maryland General Assembly
raced toward adjournment to
day with a backlog of bills
still in th/ works.
The biggest stumbling block
before the midnight deadline
was reapportionment legisla
tion hanging fire in the Sen
ate, but several other major
items were still on the agenda.
The Senate last night passed
a bill to set up a State program
for insuring accounts in sav
ings and loan associations.
The House already has passed
the measure but it will have
to go back to that body today
for concurrence in amendments.
The Senate amended the bill
to give the Governor authority
to appoint three public mem
bers of the board of directors
which would administer the
program. Under the original
bill, the Governor would ap
point only one board member
and the other 10 would come
from the savings and loan
industry.
An administration-backed
bill to regulate the home
improvement industry is await
ing final action in the Senate
after passing the House.

Mrs. Boley Describes
Murder of Newcomb
Mrs. Ruth Boley, her voice
barely intelligible, told Loudoun
County police yesterday how it
was at the Newcomb home near
Purcellville, Va., February 28—
the day an intruder stabbed her
employer to death and then
slashed her throat with a kitch
en knife.
And as sheriff’s deputies
leaned closer to her hospital
bed in Leesburg, Mrs. Boley,
the Newcomb housekeeper, con
firmed an earlier description of
the attacker and added details
of the attack.
County police had awaited
this eye-witness description of
the murder of J. Churchill New
comb, 63, since last week when
Mrs. Boley was brought to the
hospital in critical condition.
Yesterday, Mrs. Boley, 48,
told police she had been iron
ing in the kitchen of the New
comb home, 4 miles south of
Purcellville on Route 725, when
the assailant entered through a
rear hall door. She said the
man apparently was admitted
by Mr. Newcomb.
Mrs. Boley, whose home is in
Silcott Spring, Loudoun Coun
ty. said she heard loud talking
and sounds of a scuffle. She
said a man she had never seen
before then took her at gun
point to the hall, where she saw
Mr. Newcomb on the floor.

20 to 4, a bill which would have
' provided a pension for former
' Governors.
Only former Republican Gov.
i Theodore R. McKeldin had in
dorsed the bill, which passed
the House several days ago.
; Mr. McKeldin would have re
ceived $9,600 a year, based on
a scale of $1,200 for each year
! of service.
The lopsided margin of de
feat indicated that word had
i come down from Gov. Tawes
that he did not want the bill
( passed. Legislators had thought
. earlier that he favored it.
The Senate gave preliminary
approval last night to a $7.4
1 million bill to raise teachers’
pay by an average of about $250
. a year. It seemed likely, how-
• ever, that the measure would
• get lost in the last-minute
• shuffle.
A similar fate apparently
‘ awaited a S6O million veterans’
i bonus bill.
Legislation designed to pre
l vent fraudulent practices in
■ connection with the circulation
■ of referendum petitions was
! enacted by the House last night.
It also requires that the source
,1 of the petitions be disclosed.
She said the assailant hit
her with a gun and then, while
she was dazed and semi-con
scious, she saw him slash Mr.
Newcomb with a kitchen knife.
The man then turned and
slashed her, she said.
The housekeeper told ques
tioners she saw the assailant
leave through the Tear door,
taking the pistol but leaving
the knife behind.
Mrs. Boley said she managed
to reach a telephone and called
Mrs. Newcomb, who is head
mistress of the Loudoun Couaty
Country Day School in Lees
burg.
“Come quick. It is bad,” Mrs.
Boley said she told Mrs. New
comb over the phone.
Mrs. Newcomb called for
the Loudoun Rescue Squad and
sent a friend to the farmhouse
to check on the report. Mr.
Newcomb, prominent landown
er of the county, was already
dead from stab wounds in the
throat.
The description confirmed by
Mrs. Boley was that the assail
ant was white, 5 feet 7 Inches
tall, weighing about 160 pounds
and wearing a black hat, black
jacket and dark gray trousers.
She said the assailant had a
two-tone gray car, thought to
be a Buick.",metro area virginia daylight time senate vote alex preston star staff writer richmond senate action memorial labor day daylight saving time bill postpone today lace floor amendment

‘Work’ Backers
SeenOitTo
Destroy Unions
Tulsa, Okla. — AFL-CIO As
sociate Gen. Counsel Thomas E.
Harris charged here that spon
sors of a so-called “right-to
work* constitutional amendment
in Oklahoma are out “to de
stroy unions and collective bar
gaining"" as part of a “total
war"" on the labor movement.
It’s not just a “minor skir
mish’,’ he warned the Oklaho- j
ma State AFL-CIO convention, i
“You must win it,” he said.
Harris told the delegates that i
it is “surely not a coincidence"" j
that employers who are behind
the “work"" campaign are those
who are “unwilling to deal with
unions at all.""
He noted that employers “who
recognize unions, and who ex
cept to keep on recognizing
them, show little interest in
‘right-to-work’ agitation.”
The AFL-CIO attorney said
the choice of Oklahoma as the
next major battleground for
“right-to-work” was made by
“the professional war mongers
of the class war,” by people j
who, in order “to collect money
and make a living for them
selves,” are willing and in fact
eager to “show discord between
and employer associations.
Within 24 hours, Joint Council j
Manager Charles S. Zimmer- j
man said, 44 of the 80 tardy j
jobbers had settled the new
rates for each garment and all
but about 20 had complied with
the contract by the second day. i
Some 11,000 workers returned
to 180 shops after a day of
being off the job.
There was no picketing, ex
cept for one day at one shop
in Pennsylvania. Other shops
affected are in New York, New
Jersey, Connecticut, Massachu
setts, Rhode Island and Dela
ware.
The .stoppage involved dress
operators employed by some 80
jobbers who “farm out” work
under contract to 400 shops
scattered around New York and
nearby states. Under the agree
ment with the union, contrac
tors are required to pay piece
work rates negotiated every
season for every style of gar
ment. The custom has been
by the jobber and the union in
New York City.
Zimmerman had warned all
associations Feb. 7 to notify
| their members that ILGWTU
workers are not obligated to
I work on garments where the
j piecework rate has not been
worked out with the union.
Birmingham Still
Grapples With
Park Closing
Problems
Birmingham, Ala. A federal
court order desegregating Bir
mingham’s city parks took ef-,
feet March 15.
But so much had transpired
between the time the order
was first signed last November
capital and labor at a time when
national unity was never more
needed.”
The “concern” supporter of
“work” laws avow for the free
dom of workers, Harris said, is
“barefaced hypocrisy.”
“Did you ever hear of anyone
who believed in keeping wages
down who believed in unions?”
he asked. “Union exist to fight
for high wages.
‘Believes’ in Weak Union
“Did you ever hear of anyone
who believed in unions, but in
weak unions? People who be
lieve in unions at all want
strong unions.”
Granting that many people
who vote for “right-to-work”
laws are “sincere and decent,”
Harris probed into their reasons
for supporting such laws. He
said:
“I think that one main reason
is that they are nostalgic for a
simpler form of society, where j
people are not so dependent on >
each other, and on government,
as they are these days. Many
people look back to an earlier
day when, supposedly at least,
farmers owned their own small
farms and marketed their own
crops, and a shoemaker made
shoes and sold them to his
neighbors.
“Some of the people who
cherish this atavistic vision of
the good life are probably them
selves farmers who vote for
government acreage controls,
receive federal payments, and'
market their crops through
farm cooperatives, which en
joy special exemption from the
anti-trust laws.”
Harris noted that “whether
fortunately or unfortunately”
their concept of society does not
cover “the realities of life in
an industrial society in 20th
Century America.”
Industrialization, he observed
“will continue at an increasing
pace, and huge corporations will
grow huger.”

l
| and its final effective date that
the latter was anticlimactic.
The parks , had long since
been ordered closed by the
city, so the deadline had no
real meaning.
As a matter of fact, it might
well have passed unnoticed
had it not been for a last-min
ute display of what a Birming
ham News editorial called “un
usual judicial leniency.”
This came from United
States District Judge H. H.
Grooms, who had already
stayed his desegregation order
for 60 days apparently in hope
that the city would work out a
solution to its dilemma short
of closing its parks.
Judge Grooms’s second
amendment of the order ex
cepted Little League baseball
facilities located on city park
property. The boys can play
baseball as before, on a segre
gated basis—even though the
remainder of the parks in which
they play are officially closed
—at least until a decision
comes from the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals in New Or
leans and an appeal of Judge
Grooms’s ruling.
Since the order was based at
least in part on previous de
Fifth Circuit Court, there is
small likelihood that it will be
cverturned.
Mean while, Birmingham’s
parks are covered with over
growth—not all of it vcgata
i tion.
With the passage of the de
! segregation deadline it would
seem logical that the city would
have either a desegregated
park system, or no parks at all,
they having been closed to
avoid compliance with the de
segregation order.
What actually exists is a
strange mixture of both.
Four golf courses, including
one foi Negroes, are closed.
So are municipal swimming
pools and community houses
for both races. So are some
parks, or parts of some parks.
But the stadium, Legion
Field, has five Southeastern j
i
Conference football games and
more than a score of high
school games—both white and
Negro—scheduled for the fall.
Legion Field is operated on
a lease basis and individual
schools sell tickets to their
games.
Municipal Auditorium is now
reserved for “walk-around”
events (such as displays, where
visitors to the auditorium can
circulate about with no prob
lem about segregated seating
facilities) or use by private
groups.
The zoo, a botanical garden
I still under construction, the
park atop Red Mountain from
which the towering figure of
| Vulcan looks out across the
city, and a park downtown
(from which benches have
been removed) are also still
open.
Everything else, theoreti
cally, is closed. Some golfers
continued to use the courses
for a time after they were or
dered shut down (even though
th | city had filled the cups
with sod) but Public Safety
Commissioner Eugene “Bull""
Connor has lately ordered po
lice to keep all posted property
clear of “trespassers.”
Mayor Arthur J. Hanes,
however, has hinted that spe
cial permits might be granted
to private groups for “outings”
on park property. Also, some
parks adjacent to . public
schools are still used ae play
grounds during school hours,
and closed community houses
apparently can be used under
certain conditions.
There has been some local
interest in buying park facili
ties for private recreational
use. One group formed for
such a purpose has raised some
$20,000 of $400,000 it estimates
will be needed to buy the Roe
buck golf course and commu
nity center. Other citizens,
they will fight in the courts
any attempt by the city to dis
pose of public property.
Perhaps the most significant
development in the parks con
troversy has been the out
spokenness with which con
servative businessmen and
civic and religious leaders
have remanded that some at
tempt be made to reach an

arrangement under the court
order with which both races
could live together and through
which the city parks could be
kept open. Both daily news
papers disputed the closing of
the park, and open debate
raged for some weeks through
various channels — speeches,
meetings, public statements,
and letters to the editor.
The three city commission
ers, however, adamantly re
fused to consider any plan
which entailed the slightest
degree of desegregation. They
maintained that they were
elected on firm segregationist
platforms—which they were—
and that to accept integration
of the parks or anything else
would be to break faith with
the voters who put them in
office.
Some of their major backers
in the business community
were among those urging at
tempts to keep the parks open,
but the commissioners wouldn’t
budge.
They point out that many of
the leaders of the call for open
parks do not even live in Bir
mingham, but in the fashion
able “over the mountain” com
munities of Mountain Brook,
Homewood, and Vestavia, and
that they have consistently re
jected merger with the parent
city.
It is something of a paradox,
too, that at a time when sub
stantial white sentiment for
open parks — which under the
court order can mean only one
thing, mixed parks — leans in
the direction of accepting at
least a limited degree of deseg
regation, solution of racial
problems actually seems to be
in the process of becoming
more difficult.
The city commissioners, elect
ed to four-year terms last year,
are unbending in their segrega
tionist positions.
At the same time there is
| evidence that conservative, in
' fluential Negro leaders who
have thus far been able to ex
I ercise some restraint in de
mands of their race locally, may
be having more and more trou
| ble keeping some younger Ne
groes, who are impatient with
; apparent unwillingness of city
officials to demonstrate even
token compliance with a court
order to desegregate one muni
cipal activity, from pushing fall
speed ahead for integration of
every area of community life.
| Moderate leaders of both
races are still hopeful of reach
ing agreements, even though
biracial meetings (quite rare
i in Birmingham in recent years)
held during the parks contro
versy failed to produce tangi
ble results or concrete propo
sals. But other forces are at
work which could make solu
tion of racial problems more
and more difficult.

Support Mounting
Rapidly For
Huddleston Bill
Washington, D. C. — A bill
authored by Alabama Repre
sentative George Huddleston,
Jr., to prohibit Federal funds
for promoting trade for St.
Lawrence Seaway ports, was
reported ‘going great guns”
today.
Congressman Huddleston said
that other congressman from
Alabama and the Gulf States
had indicated to him that the
measure would have their back
ing. Strongly supported by the
Alabama State Docks System,
the bill is now before the House
Public Works Committee,
Rep. Charles Buckley, Chair
man of the House Public Works
Committee, has assured Rep.
Huddleston that reports have
been requested on the measure

that the Gulf Port Association
is plumping hard for the bill.
This association represents 16
ports on the Gulf of Mexico.
Earlier, the Mobile Area Cham
ber of Commerce had endorsed
the Huddleston Bill, and addi
tional support has been offered
by other groups ranging from
the Sylacauga Chamber of Com
merce to the Traffic Club of
Galveston, Texas.
Rep. Huddleston introduced
the legislation when he learned
that over $65,000 per year in
Federal funds were being spent
on activities which promoted
trade for St. Lawrence Seaway
, and Great Lake ports. Other
ports systems, including Ala
bama’s Port of Mobile, have
to use their own money for
such promotional activities.

New York Drafts Plan
For Teacher Pay Raise
NEW YORK, April 13 (AP>.—The State’s Republican Gov
ernor and the city’s Democratic Mayor met for‘3V a hours here
last night and came up with a formula that will give city schools
an additional sl3 million and possibly permit final settle
ment of the dispute that led to a one-day teachers’ strike.
The strike by the United Federation of Teachers (AFL-CIO)
was called off yesterday follow
ing a court order.
Charles Cogen, president of
the union, said last night that
with the additional funds ""we
think we can go back and ne
gotiate.”
The formula by which the
State gives aid to city schools
has been a bone of contention
between Gov. Nelson A. Rocke
feller and Mayor Robert F.
Wagner, with Mr. Wagner
charging that the State had
“short-changed” the city and
Gov. Rockefeller calling the
Mayor a ""buck-passer.”
Caught in the middle, the.
Board of Education said it could
not possibly offer the city’s
teachers more than a total of
S2B million in raises for the
next fiscal year. The teacher
federation, demanding $53 mil
lion—but in no case less than
$33.8 million—called the strike.
The one-day walkout crippled
the city’s 900 schools, closing
some of them, and disrupting
classes for their million pupils
Wednesday.
The conference, attended by
Gov. Rockefeller and Mr. Wag
ner, along with city, State,
school and teacher officials, was
the first known meeting be
tween the two men on the is
sue.
It was held in the Governor’s
Manhattan office and ended
with a joint statement by the
two men. Their agreement
enables the city to borrow the
THE FEDERAL SPOTLIGHT
Senate Hearings Are Scheduled
On Retirement Credit Transfer
By JOSEPH YOUNG
Star Staff Writer
Senate hearings have been
scheduled for May 10 on legis
lation to provide an interchange
of credits between the civil
service retirement and social
security systems to bolster the
annuities of Federal workers on
retirement.
The bill is sponsored by Sen
ator Clark, Democrat of Penn
sylvania, who also is chairman
of the Senate Civil Service sub
committee which will hold the
hearings.
The bill permits Federal
workers with less-than-enough
previous non-Government serv
ice to qualify them for social
security benefits to transfer
whatever social security credits
they have to the civil service
retirement system. This would
give the employes greater civil
service annuities on retirement.
They would have to pay into
the retirement fund the differ
ence between what they paid in
social security taxes and what
they would have paid into civil
service retirement had they
been in the Government during
that time.
Also, the bill permits short
time Federal employes on leav
ing Government to transfer
credit for their Federal service
to the social security system to
help them qualify for social
security benefits.
In addition, the bill would
abolish the requirement that
employes who retire have to
take a cut in annuity in order
that their widow or dependent
widower can get a survivorship
annuity when the annuitant
dies.
Also, the bill would give re
tired Federal workers an in
crease equal to the pay raise
that is enacted for Government
workers this year. Also, there
would be automatic increases
in retiree annuities every time
the cost of living rises by 1 per
cent or more.
Senator Clark said his sub
committee hearings at the same
time would also take up the
bill to extend from 18 to 21
the age in which student chil-
$48.6 million It needs for cur
rent school operations from the
$62 million it is to receive next
September.
After the city repays the $48.6
in September, it will have $13.4
million—less interest charges.
It then will keep borrowing
from year to year, under a plan
of deferred payment.
Max J. Rubin, education
board president, made clear it
would not all be used for raises.
The teachers asked that sal
aries now ranging from $4,800
to $8,650 a year, plus bonuses,
be increased to $5,400 to $9,500.
plus bonuses.
Westmore Group
Elects Officers
Curtis Mackereth, Federal!
Government employe, was
elected president of the West
more Citizens Association of
Fairfax City last' night.” [
Mr. Mackereth will take of
fice May 10, replacing outgoing'
president Ellsworth DeMasters.
Also elected to one-year
terms last night were Robert.
C. Williams, vice president:
Mrs Louise Mahoney, secretary,
and Mrs. Marcella Witt, treas
urer.
The annual election was held
at Westmore Elementary
School in Fairfax City.
I dren of deceased Federal work
ers could continue to receive
survivorship benefits. Under the
bill, these children could re
ceive the benefits up to age
21 if they were going to school
on a full-time basis.
Another bill to be taken up
at the hearing would give cer
tain Federal employes credit
for retirement purposes for
past State service. .

HOUSE PAY HEARING SET
—The House Civil Service Com
mittee has set May 3 as the
starting date for hearings on
Federal classified and postal
employe pay raise legislation.
The committee acted favor
ably on a motion made by Rep
resentative Broyhill, Republi
can of Virginia, to schedule the
pay raise hearings. The Senate
Civil Service Committee already
has begun pay raise hearings
but has not yet completed them.
The House committee also
voted to take up legislation to
increase retired Federal em
ploye annuities immediately
after the pay raise hearings are
concluded.
The House committee ap
proved the bill to allow un
claimed amounts of insurance
under the Federal employe life
insurance program to revert to
the Federal employe life insur
ance fund. At present, when
there is no legal next-of-kin,
the money usually goes to the
State in which the employe had
lived.
CAREERIST BAN Senator
Williams, Republican of Dela
ware, has filed formal notice in
the Senate that he will offer
an amendment to the second
sup piemental appropriations
bill to bar the payment of sal
aries to Federal career employes
who advocate or defend admin
' istration policies before public
' groups. The Senate takes up
the bill next Monday.
Senator Williams’ amend-
• ment stems from the recent
• Civil Service Commission mem

MICHIGAN WOMEN
DUE MAN'S PAY
FOR EQUAL WORK
LANSING, Mich., (AP I .
—Women must be paid as
much as men if they per
form the same work, under
a new law in Michigan.
Gov. John Swainson
signed the equal-pay bill
yesterday, surrounded by
women who helped push it
through the legislature.
From now on. any em
ployer who discriminates in
wages between men and
women similarly employed
will be guilty of a misde
meanor. Wage discrimina
tion must be based on fac
tors other than sex.
The State already had a
law forbidding discrimina
tion on account of sex in
manufacturing employ
ment.

With the Peace Corps bill on
its way to the President for

only one important measure on
which to act before it tackles
the controversial issue of lit

Easter.
Also en route to the White

craft, missiles and naval vessels,
including $320 million more
than the administration re
quested for development of the
RS7O plane.
The House completed action
on this bill yesterday by ac-I

The Peace Corps and military

The Senate Subcommittee on
Constitutional Rights ended
hearings on the literacy bills
yesterday, with Chairman Er
vin, Democrat of North Caro
lina, announcing he will seek
early action by the subcom
mittee if he can get a quorum
before Easter.
But, regardless of what ac
tion is taken in Committee,:
Democratic Leader Mansfield
has served notice he will call
up one of the literacy bills fori
floor debate within a few days
after Easter Monday.
Senator Ervin said today he
is still convinced any attempt:
by Congress to fix voter qual
ifications would be unconstl
tutional.
Sets Standard
But Northern Senators in
both parties are just as firm
in the view Congress has the
power to ban discriminatory
literacy tests.
The administration contends
its bill does not fix voter quali-
fications, but merely seeks to
establish a standard for pre
venting discrimination in ap
plying literacy tests. It does
this by declaring that a State
cannot deprive a person of his
vote on the basis of a perform
ance test or examination if the
applicant has completed the
sixth grade in school.
Southern Democrats will talk
at length to prevent pasage of
a literacy bill, and Northern
liberals will try to broaden the
bill to cover other subjects,
including school integration,
fair employment practices and
the elimination of segregation
in all public facilities.

Western leaders
try compromise
on 6% bid help
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
group of Western congressmen
agreed Tuesday to offer a
compromise to head off a
move in the House to elimi
nate a 6% bid advantage for
West Coast shipyards on con
tracts involving government
subsidy.
Rep. Thor C. Tollefson, R
daughter, of Mr. and Mrs.
Bobby Mack Anderson, 225 W.
Dupont Avenue, Pascagoula,
was born at Singing River
Hospital. She weighed six
pounds, seven ounces on ar
rival Apr. 5.
JOYCE C. MANSFIELD
Mr. and Mrs. Alton Willard
Mansfield, 802 S. Pascagoula
Street, Pascagoula, have nam
ed their fourth child, a daugh
ter, Joyce Claire. She was
bom at Singing River Hospital
Apr. 6 weighing eight pounds.
Wash., said about 40 congress
men or their representatives
attended a strategy meeting to
discuss ways to meet a bill by
Rep. William M. Colmer, D
Miss., that would repeal the
6% differential.
Colmar's bill has been
cleared by the rules com
mittee and is to come up foe
House debate Thursday.
In a related move, Rep.
Thomas M. Pelly, R-Wash., in
troduced a bill Tuesday that
would substitute a regional
allocation system for the dif
ferential setup.
Tollefson said the compro
mise proposal would be offer
ed in the form of two amend
ments to the 1936 law that
provides for the differential.
One amendment would sub
stitute a 4% differential for
the present 6%. This, he said,
is based on a recent report by
the maritime administration
which concluded that a 4.2%
cost differential exists on the
West Coast in comparison
with ship construction on the
East. Gulf, and Great Lakes
coasts.
The second amendment
would establish a regional
contract allocation system
under which the secretary of
commerce could ask for bids
on ship construction in a
specific area if ha found the
work was needed there be
cause of a depressed con
dition in the industry.
Pelly’s bill would have a
similar arrangement. His
amendment would provide for
the number of ships involving
construction subsidies to be
divided into four groups at the
beginning of each fiscal year.
One group would be designat
ed for each of the coasts.
The groups would be figur
ed on the basis of the over-all
number of subsidy contracts
available in relation to the
facilities in privately owned
shipyards in each region that
are equipped to build the
ships.
Pally axplainad that if iha
secretary of commerce de
termined the lowest bid re
ceived under such an ar
rangement. he would reject
all bids from that region
and invite bids on a nation
wide basis.
The differential was origin
ally set up on the ground that
ship construction costs are
greater on the West Coast
than on the East Colmer and
other opponents of the differ
ential contend it is no longer
needed.
Among all the flags of the
United Nations, only that of
Cyprus bears a map of the
country.

ESTES
Over 1,000 Quizzed
In Widening Probe
Continued From Page A-l
who bought great quantities
of liquid fertiliser from the
chemical firm, are under in
vestigation.
The Senate subcommittee,
headed by Senator McClellan.
Democrat of Arkansas, said it
had no evidence of any link be
tween Estes and Mr. Pratt, but)
would look into the death be
cause of a cryptic note found
in Mr. Pratt's car which said in
part . the burden of guilt
is on my shoulders . .
Connection Doubted
Investigators said they
doubted Mr. Pratt had any con
nection with Estes.
A House subcommitte headed
by Representative Fountain,
Democrat of North Carolina,
plans to start hearings Monday
on the Estes case, with political
controversy swirling about its!
ears.
Senator Dirksen of Illinois, the ■
Senate Republican leader, ac
cused the subcommittee's staff!
of leaking to the press what he
called politically inspired ""petty
hinting and subtle innuendo”
about two brothers of former
President Eisenhower.
His statements were prompted
by a New York Herald Tribune
story published yesterday which
quoted an ""expert” on the
House subcommittee’s staff in
connection with reports that
the names of Edgar Eisenhower
and the late Arthur Eisenhower
might figure in the hearings
on matters completely unre
lated to Estes.
""If there is something to be
investigated, by all means let
them do so without further
delay and stop the petty hint
ing a subtle innuendo by staff
people."" Senator Dirksen said.
He called the leak a ""punitive
and retaliatory” reaction to
scandals which have linked the
names of some Kennedy ad
ministration officials with
Estes.
""To Shift Attention”
In Tacoma. Wash., Edgar
Eisenhower, a lawyer, declared,
“The whole purpose of this is
to take the heat off this ad
ministration ... to take the
heat off this Billie Sol Estes
investigation. They are trying
to shift attention.
""I don't know anything about
the Estes problem except what
I have read in the papers. If
they are trying to connect me,
with that situation, it is a great
distortion. I never heard of
the man until I saw his name
in the paper.”
The former President’s
TOBRINER

well as receiving testimony!
from public witnesses.
Mr. Tobriner’s action was'
viewed by one source close to
the subcommittee as the first
time in recent years the Com
missioners have ever presented i
anything but a united front on,
a given issue before an appro-:
priations committee.
The deecision on whether to
approve appropriations re- j
quested to start the two projects j
rests with the House subcom
mittee, headed by Representa
tive Natcher. Democrat of Ken
tucky. The subcommittee is ex
pected to mark up the District
budget within two or three
weeks.
Asked to confirm Mr. To-’
briner’s stand Mr. Natcher
would only say, “I have no com
ment at this time.” The Com
missioner also declined to dis-|
cuss the issue before today's I
meeting.
The budget under considera- !
tion requests $170,000 in Dis
trict funds for the east leg.
Matched with Federal funds
the cost would total $1.7 mil
lion. Total cost of the project
is $42.5 million.
For the interchange. $547,000
is requested which, matched
with Federal funds, would total
$5.5 million. Total cost Is set
at $15.9 million.
Congress already has appro
priated about $3 million for
various studies involving the
two projects.
Previous objections to run
ning the east leg along the west
bank of the Anacostla were
based on the difficulty In ob
taining rights of way across
land now owned by the National
Park Service and the Agricul
ture Department. It was under
stood the road probably would
have to run into sections of
the National Arboretum, oper
ated by Agriculture.
Apart from the difficulty of,
getting approval to run such a
road through park lands near
the Anacostla, the District in
1950 gave assurances to the
Department of Agriculture and
to Congress that it would not
in the future request permis
sion to put a highway through,
the Arboretum. This commit
ment. it was understood, was;
made in connection with con-'
cessions given the District to!
build the East Capitol Street
Bridge.
Past Actions Cited
The east leg route, which
would run between Tenth and
Eleventh streets S.E. from the
Anacostla River to Tenth street
and Florida avenue N.E., was
approved by the present Board
of Commissioners last Novem
ber.
The Commissioners also in
dorsed this construction plan
in submitting their budget re
quests to Congress last January.
The Commissioners also
backed the east leg project on
at least one other occasion
recently, this time in answer to
a question at one of President
I brother said Mr. Fountain in
; vited him to come to Washing-
> ton ""a long time ago.” Said
. Mr. Eisenhower:
”1 told him on the telephone
I wouldn’t go . . . didn’t have
any interest in any grain stor
! age and didn't see why I should
. pay my way back there to tell
!,him so. I told him I didn’t
’ have at any time, and haven’t
I now. a nickel’s worth of in
t terest in wheat storage or grain
storage.”
""I want you to know,” he de
clared. ""that politics have hit
; a new low.”
The House group, the Sub
committee on Intergovern
mental Relations, has juris
diction over surplus grain stor
l age and cotton allotments. It
, will look into Estes' profitable
operations under both pro
grams.
No Decision Reached
The House subcommittee
' counsel, James R. Naughton,
said no decision has been
reached on whether it will in
vestigate the Eisenhowers.
Meanwhile, Representative
Andersen. Republican of Min
nesota. became the second Con
gress member to volunteer pub-
I licly to testify before Senator
McClellan’s subcommittee after
his name had been linked with
Estes.
Senator Yarborough. Derno-
■ crat of Texas, previously had
announced he was offering to
testify. He acknowledged ac
cepting about $7,500 from
Estes in campaign contribu
tions and to help finance the
Senator’s radio broadcasts to
constituents.
Mr. Andersen has said he sold
Estes $4,000 worth of stock in a
Washington State coal mine
owned partly by the Congress
man. Mr. Andersen said the
FBI has checked his records
and ""I am sure they will find
that everything is in proper
order.”
Senator McClellan has stated
that any Congress member
whose name is mentioned in
the hearings will have a chance
to become a witness.
Estes is awaiting trial on
Federal fraud charges and a
Texas indictment accusing him
[of theft.

Democrats Object
Coming down hard on the
freeway plans in public testi
mony Tuesday and last night
before the subcommittee has
been the Democratic Central
Committee of the District.
Mrs. Polly Shackleton. Na-!
tional Committeewoman, said
Tuesday “we are shocked by the
utter ruthlessness and inhu
manity” of the program. She
added:
“The Highway Department
exhibits no concern over the
! effects of its program on one 1
of the Nation's Capital’s most
compelling human needs—the
need for decent, safe and san
itary housing for its resi
dents. . . .” She estimated
""many thousands” would be
displaced by the freeway con
struction.
Last night. Robert G. Mc-
Guire, president of the Wash
ington Urban League, testified
that the city “has no effective
program for providing reloca
tion service for rehousing fam
ilies who will be required to
move.” He estimated 10,000
persons would be displaced by
the Northeast freeway and the
east leg.
And Philip Schwartz, repre
senting the Americans for
Democratic Action, added that
the ""inadequate relocation
services in the District... com
; pel us to support at least a par
tial moratorium on highway
projects.”
, Arnold C. Sternberg, appear
ing on behalf of the Demo
cratic Central Committee, at
tacked the program from
, another angle. He said general
• fund revenues have been di
[ verted into the highway fund,
; and charged, “the highway fund
is unable to meet its obligations
under the grossly accelerated
program proposed. ...”
i; Taking issue with this stand,
; however, was J. C. Turner,
i president of the Greater Wash
ington Central Labor Council.
Mr. Turner pointed out the
District Commissioners recently
approved the concept of a
' Central Relocation Service for
I families displaced by highway
' construction. ""Without a work-
■ able and fair program of re
location, neither the highway
I program nor the urban renewal
program can go forward,” he
said.
Urging adoption of the high-
> way program, Mr. Turner em
phasized: ""Let it not be for-
. gotten that the thousands of
• jobs resulting from this pro
i gram will be of enormous as
i sistance in ridding the District
•of the rolls of the unem
; ployed.”

j EL PASO. Tex., May 24 (AP).
s—Billie 5 —Billie Sol Estes refused to
. answer most questions about
i his collapsed empire of farm-
.’ related enterprises at a hearing
? before his creditors yesterday,
j' After the court session, re
cessed until June 15 by United
I States District Judge R. E.
t Thomason, there were hints
, that the huge complex of busi
nesses built by Estes might be
, forced into bankruptcy.
i So far, as creditors seek to
I recover part of their invest-
• ment, the affairs of the 37-
year-old Pecos, Tex., financier
I are in the hands of a court-
■ appointed receiver.
! Estes, serious of mien but
occasionally smiling, invoked!
the Fifth Amendment six times.
i He declined to answer ques
, tions dealing with his multi
i million-dollar operations in
selling liquid fertilizer, storing
grain for the Government and
growing cotton under trans
ferred acreage allotments.
Faces Charges
1 One of his ‘lawyers, John
■ Cofer of Austin, safti replies by
5 Estes might tend to incrim
s inate him in view of the pend-
- ing charges. He has been in
-3 dieted on Federal charges of
fraud and State charges of
theft.
“It is difficult to see how
the questions would incrlmin
k ate you,” Judge Thomason told
. Estes, ""but we still have a Con
. jstitution ”
Estes would not state his oc
cupation or the site of his of
fices. He refused to say
whether he had delivered all
1 records to the receiver, to dis
. I cuss his list of assets or to say
whether he was interested in a
Jirm named Agriculture, Inc.
He advised the court, how
ever, that he would submit a
detailed statement of assets by
June 15. Estes said he would’
. be here for further questions
i then.
I Owes S3B Million
Receiver Harry Moore, jr., of
!E1 Paso reported a preliminary
I check showed Estes’ liabilities
, amounted to $38,387,935 and
his assets totaled $20,793,154. |
Judge Thomason named Mr. I
> Moore trustee in event Estes is l
forced into bankruptcy. His
• lawyers have said that Estes i
> was not bankrupt but disrupted ■
, (finances made it impossible to
t meet his obligations.
, Mr. Moore will ask officials
!in Washington Monday to
. nullify an Agriculture Depart
] ment order for removal of
, about 45 million bushels of
stored grain from elevators
formerly under Estes’ control.
Judge Hiomason said hopes
of creditors to collect rest
■ largely on continued rental
i payments of $4 to $5 milion a

’ Hearings on
j Redistricting
1 ATLANTA, May 24 (AP).—A
■ three-judge Federal court has
- completed a hearing on a con-;
i gressional redistricting petition
for Georgia which could set a
. precedent for other States.
Chief Judge Elbert P. Tuttle
. of the sth Circuit Court of Ap
i peals said the most difficult
1 problem in his mind is whether
. the Federal court has jurisdic
, tion since the United States
1 Constitution granted Congress
; the right to compel States to
I redistrict.
Distdict Judge Lewis R.
Morgan concurred. The other
’ panel member. District Judge
’ Griffin Bell, was hospitalized
with a back injury and listened
' to arguments over an intercom
: munication system in his hos
r pital room.
1 Judge Tuttle gave attorneys
r for both sides 10 to 15 days to
’ submit briefs on whether any
’ action by the court requiring
’ redistricting would be interfer
? ing with the functions of Con
-1 gress.
5 The judge also raised the
question of whether congres-
- sional redistricting in Georgia
- should be left up to a reap-
- portioned State Legislature.
f The Legislature would be re-
- vised only on order of the same
• Federal panel which spent the
t first two days of the week hear-

! amendment and the second on
feed grains.
The President’s wheat and
feed grains proposals both were
beaten by one-vote margins in
the Senate Agriculture Com
mittee. His backers now are
trying to reverse these defeats
on the floor.
The administration amend
ments are being pushed by
Committee Chairman Ellender,
Democrat of Louisiana. They
would establish stricter controls
over production in an effort to
cut down the $7.5-billion sur
plus stockpile.
Both the wheat and feed
grains programs would have to
be adopted by votes of two
thirds of the growers in a
referendum to become effective.
Senator Ellender’s wheat
amendment would strike out
of the bill authority Inserted
by his committee for producers
to vote for a two-year extension
of the temporary wheat pro
gram now in effect. This pro
gram calls for a 10 per cent
acreage reduction.
The feed grains amendment
would strike out of the bill a
one-year extension of the pres
ent voluntary feed grains pro
gram and provide instead for
a permanent marketing quota
program covering com, barley
and sorghums.
Nearly all Republicans are
expected to oppose the Presi
dent’s proposals. But Demo

confident of holding most of
their members in line, includ

Final passage of the bill is
not expected until tomorrow.

other provisions.
Jury to Study
New Autopsy
On Marshall
FRANKLIN, Tex., May 24
(AP).—County grand jurors
hope to find answers today to
two questions in the death of
Henry Marshall.
They want to know whether
Mr. Marshall, a State agricul
tural official, was murdered or
committed suicide, and whether
his death had any connection
with the complex affairs of
Financier Billie Sol Estes. He
had been checking Estes’ cot
ton acreage allotments prior to
his death nearly a year ago.
Dr. J. A. Jachimczyk, a Hous
ton pathologist, was to present
his final autopsy report to the
grand jury. He said two days
ago, after preliminary examina
tion of the exhumed body, that
he believed Mr. Marsnall did
not commit suicide.
Hint Shot in Back
District Attorney Bryan Russ
said the physician’s view was
based on a belief that one of
the five bullets striking Mr.
Marshall entered the dead
man’s back. Dr. Jachimczyk de
clined to discuss this point with
newsmen.
Mr. Marshall was found dead
last June 3 on his farm near
here. He had been shot five
times with a ,22-caliber, bolt
action rifle.
Justice of the Peace Lee
Farmer ruled suicide without
ordering an autopsy. An au
topsy was performed by court
order Tuesday.
If the pathologist’s report
confirms the murder theory,
Mr. Russ said the grand jury
will consider motives and pos
sible suspects.
Under subpoena to testify
was William Elliott, an investi
gator for the United States Ag
riculture Department, stationed
at Temple. Tex. Mr. Elliott
was directed to produce a re
port on cotton allotments pre
sumably based on findings by
Mr. Marshall.
In a telegram to Secretary
of Agriculture Freeman, Mr.
Russ and Texas Attorney Gen
eral Will Wilson said the re
port by Mr. Marshall was titled
""Billie Sol Eestes—Pecos, Tex.”
and was not completed until
last October.
FBI Acts in Case
The Federal Bureau of In
vestigation is working with
State officials in the reopened
investigation of Mr. Marshall’s
death.
| Members of the grand jury
went to the spot where Mr.
Marshall’s body was found
yesterday. Mr. Russ said this
was ""an attempt to solidify
the thinking of the jury.”
District Judge John Barron
said he had conferred with
Dr. Jachimczyk and felt that
the pathologist's earlier re
port of murder would not be
changed.
“If this is murder,” Judge
Barron said, “there are some
people we will be wanting to
talk to.”
He didn’t indicate who these
individuals might be.
HOLTZOFF
Continued From Page A-l
rule on the motion from the
bench yesterday, but then said
he would put his thoughts in
writing. The written ruling,
which granted the defense re
quest, was issued today.
First, he said that ""judicial
etiquette and canons of good
taste” barred a judge from
discussing outside of proper
judicial channels statements
about his actions.
The judge said this was true
""Irrespective of whether they
were correct or incorrect,
justified or unjustified.” For
this reason, he said, ""my Ups
have been sealed.”
Cites His Duty
But, the judge said, the case
now was before him as part of
his judicial function. He said
his duty now required him to
""analyze” the appellate court’s
opinion.
""Judge Danaher’s opinion,”
Judge Holtzoff said, “is exceed
ingly prolix and constitutes a
disorganized, desultory, dia
tribe.” He said the opinion dis
cussed a number of points, but
decided only one.
Judge Holtzoff said the ap
pellate court apparently only
ruled that statements by Naples
during a re-enactment of the
crime should have been ex
cluded at the trial.
“Interspersed (in Judge
Danaher’s opinion) are a num
ber of personal observations in
a somewhat petulant tone,”
Judge Holtzoff said. He said
Judge Danaher seemed
“piqued” at one point.
Judge Holtzoff said Judge
Danaher apparently was piqued
by the fact that Judge Holtzoff
ihad once written two articles
praising the English appellate
court.
Cites “Misunderstanding”
Judge Holtzoff concluded
with some general remarks
about what he called “a grow
ing misunderstanding as to the
respective functions of trial
and appellate courts.”
The judge said that interme
diate appellate courts, which
historically came after trial
courts had been established, are
sometimes said to exercise “su
pervisory jurisdiction.”
“This is a picturesque and an
apt figure of speech and, as
such it has its usefulness,” hq
said. “But like figures of
speech generally, it must not
be taken seriously.”
""Strictly speaking, interme
diate appellate courts have no
supervisory jurisdiction,” Judge
Holtzoff said. His statement
underscored what appears to be
a deep difference of opinion.

Full Representation
There is a practical advantage, we
suppose, in the argument of Senator
Keating of New York that congressional
representation for the District of Colum
bia should be restricted to the House
of Representatives. For while the House
refused to go along, the Senate two
years ago accepted this limited form
of representation during the preliminary
voting on the constitutional amendment
which has granted Washingtonians the
right to vote for President and Vice
President.
But Senator Bush of Connecticut
is entirely right when he says that this
is not enough, that District residents
will attain the full rights of citizenship
due them only when they achieve vot
ing representation in the Senate as well
as in the House. And it is refreshing to
near this right upheld in so candid and
forthright a manner.
In time, we have no doubt that
Washingtonians will gain their full
measure of enfranchisement. The
amendment to the Constitution which
has enabled them to vote for President
in 1964 is a gratifying and long-delayed
first step. If now a second amendment
on voting rights were limited to rep
resentation in the House, a third in
evitably would follow to encompass the
Senate at some date in the future. It
would be too bad to have to invoke the
difficult and complex procedures of
constitutional amendment in three
bites, when two would suffice.
No Mitigating Factor
District Court Judge McGarraghy
used justifiably strong language in re
fusing to reduce the death sentence
imposed on William Coleman for the
murder of a policeman following a
liquor store robbery in 1960. Recalling
that the Court of Appeals, in upholding
.the conviction, described the killing as
a “savage and desperate” attempt by
Coleman to shoot his way past the
Officer in an alley, Judge McGarraghy
added succinctly: “Undoubtedly, more
revolting killings are conceivable, but
that fact does not of Itself constitute
a mitigating circumstance.”
Coleman was convicted of wresting
the officer’s gun away from him when
the latter trapped him outside the
liquor store immediately after the hold
up, in which another policeman was
shot. He turned the gun against the
officer, fatally wounding him. Cole
man's attorney appealed the conviction
in vain to the Court of Appeals and
the Supreme Court. Then came a plea
for reduction of sentence, based largely
on the ground that since the Imposition
of the death sentence a new law has
made it discretionary with juries as to
whether execution or a life sentence
is the penalty for first degree murder.
“Police officers,” Judge McGarraghy
said, “are engaged in the dangerous
business of protecting the public from
vicious criminals. When they become
the victims of such criminals, the pub
lic interest, both from the point of view
of deterrence and of punishment, re
quires that the penalty fixed by law
be carried into effect.” This is sound
doctrine.
Library for the Nation
The Nation and its historians are
the true beneficiaries of dedication
ceremonies recently on the outskirts
of the little Kansas town of Abilene.
For it was there that the latest of pres
idential libraries, a storehouse of records
and papers relating not only to eight
years of a national administration but
to an earlier span of momentous mili
tary events, was handed over officially
to the keeping of the Federal Govern
ment.
This was the Eisenhower Library,
an impressive new structure that dom
inates a 13-acre site also containing the
boyhood home of the soldier-President.
Citizens of fifty States contributed to
the financing of this future center of
study and research, to be administered
henceforth by the National Archives
Service of the General Services Admin
istration. Already on its miles of shelves
are films and documents supplementing
other Government and public records of
policy-making and action-taking during
General Eisenhower's two terms in the
Presidency. The files of other members
of iiis official family, including those of
thf late Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles, will be added. And of greatly
added value in this case will be many
of General Eisenhower's papers from the
SATURDAY, MAY 26, 1962
World War II period, including some of
his own, and some of his military staff
members, still bearing top secret class
ification.
The worth of this manner of bring
ing together the most detailed and per
sonal of a President’s records already
has been well demonstrated and it has,
in fact, been improved and expanded in
modem times. On the campus of Stan
ford University in Palo Alto, California,
the Hoover Library has become recog
nized as a highly useful research center.
The same applies to the F. D. Roosevelt
Library in Hyde Park, N. Y., and even
more complete as a source for study of
the years involved is the Truman Library
in Independence, Missouri. The Eisen
hower Library is a valuable addition to
this distinguished group.
It's Greener Here
For some eight years, although as
sertedly not a member of the party,
David Paul Johnson had been an active
Communist sympathizer in Philadelphia.
The Soviet Union, he was convinced at
the time, grew grass much greener than
America’s.
So 32-year-old Mr. Johnson, with
ideological stars in his eyes, decided just
a short time ago to give up his railroad
job (it paid him over sllO a week), sell
his possessions and set sail with his
family for the Marxist-Leninist para
dise of the USSR. His Intention was to
settle down over there and begin a new
life. This life, he was sure—having in
mind all the glowing party-line litera
ture he had devoured avidly and with
relish—would be far better than his
bourgeois existence in Philadelphia.
Well, once he arrived in the USSR,
Mr. Johnson, whose wife and children
apparently were never particularly
eager to leave their home in the City
of Brotherly Love, learned fast. In fact,
within one week after arriving in Len
ingrad, he knew that he had made “an
exceptionally tragic mistake.” He noted
right away that the Soviet Union was
not in any sense comparable to the land
of his dreams, and his erstwhile party
line enchantment soon changed into
utter disenchantment.
Thus, looking around over there,
Mr. Johnson discovered almost imme
diately that the consumer-goods situa
tion (including food) was bad and that
housing was unbelievably scarce. Also,
some people on the streets wanted to
buy the clothes he wore. All the Soviet
propaganda of the past, the stuff he had
accepted as gospel truth, suddenly fell
apart before his eyes. Now with the
naivete gone from his mind, he recog
nized the whole business as a colossal
lie that had bamboozled him.
In sum, what Mr. Johnson has
learned is that American grass, in terms
of individual freedom and personal liv
ing standards, is incomparably greener
than Red Russia’s. His eyes have been
opened wide on that score, and so let us
welcome him back as a man who has
frankly admitted his quite foolish
mistake.
Tories on Defense
Local elections in England and
Wales in recent weeks have produced one
loser and two winners. The loser, not
unexpectedly, was the Conservative
Party, which suffered a net loss of more
than 500 seats in the municipal councils
of 428 boroughs. One winner, fully in
keeping with the seesaw movement of
two-party political strength in Britain
for more than 40 years past, was the
Labor Party, which scored net gains of
approximately 260 seats. The other win
ner, and the one that may represent a
truly new force in modern British poli
tics (meaning since World War I), was
the Liberal Party, which picked up a
net of at least 325 seats.
In the working of British politics,
the results of these local elections do
not necessarily affect policies of the na
tional government—which has been
Conservative since 1951—and which may
not be forced to the test of a general
election until the fall of 1964. Further
more, with a party margin of more
than 100 votes in the House of Com
mons, the Conservative government is
reasonably insured against a Parliamen
tary defeat that might force earlier
elections. Even so, as a practical matter,
the local voting shows quite clearly that
there is at least a public restiveness
about the Conservative stewardship, and
that simply moving to Labor leadership
is less than the complete answer.
It is noteworthy that the local elec
tions were fought out almost entirely on
domestic issues—among them the Con
servative government’s deflationary
budget, the fact that Britain’s economy
currently is marking time while that
of continental Western Europe is more
buoyant, and a subtle annoyance—taken
out on the Conservatives—that Britain’s
bid to join the Common Market has not
drawn prompt and unconditional ap
proval by the Common Market members.
The English-Welsh voting indicates a
new impatience with both of the major
parties.
Actually, the Liberal Party Itself
does not offer very concrete alterna
tives. In some respects it is to the left
of the Labor Party, in others to the
right. The Economist speaks of the
“muzziness” of certain Liberal policy
positions, and even the party leadership,
is quoted equivocally about being against
nationalization but in favor of democ
ratization, encouraging free enterprise
but favoring stronger curbs on concen
tration of business power, and so on.
There is some reason to believe, in fact,
that the Liberal leadership is delighted
with the party’s new popularity but not
quite sure what to do about it. In this
circumstance, there are no serious fore
casts now that the Liberals might win
a general election in 1964, or sooner if
there is an earlier test. As a third choice,
however, the party could exercise a
balance of power and be a major in
fluence upon the behavior of its two
stronger rivals.

'Enjoying My Old Office, Mike?'
LETTERS TO THE STAR
Feeding Red China
Disturbing to this reader is
the growing sentiment that
the United States should sup
ply food to the starving
masses in Red China on a
humanitarian level. Empha
sized is the fact that there
are unfortunate millions suf
fering the pangs of hunger
while we enjoy the benefit of
unmeasured surplus; inher
ent in the argument is an
emotional appeal which all
but obliterates a reflective
consideration of the conse
quences of such a program
of aid.
Ignored in the typical com
mentary of this sort is the
fact that Red China, no less
than Russia, represents not
only a potential, but a very
real kinetic enemy ideologi
cally. militarily, economical
ly. How easy to offer an
appeal to sympathy on the
basis of pure emotion while
omitting mention that this
same nation daily drives
deeper into Vietnam, into
Laos.
The real tragedy of the
situation is not that the Chi
nese are hungry, but rather
lies in the fact that these
same people must be associ
ated with a government,
which may or may not repre
sent their true personal senti
ment, in such away as to ren
der the possibility of such aid
a nullity. If it were possible
to separate a consideration
of the people themselves from
their identification with the
government, the suggestion
of such direct relief might
well be considered. Sad to
say, such a distinction is
realistically impossible.
We are in a tortuous po
sition of having to balance a
consideration of the needs of
suffering individuals, against
the long-range effect of such
aid. Our leanings are imme
diately to help anyone, on a
personal basis, who so obvi
ously needs what we enjoy in
surplus. What is necessary
also, however, is a mature
reflection on the results of
our good will.
True, there are individuals
suffering from starvation;
true we have food we can
send. Unfortunately, it is
true also that the govern
ment of Red China derives its
strength and vitality from
these people and that we are
face-to-face, hot and cold,
with this government which
has continuously pronounced
a policy of inevitable con
flict with the West.
Regardless of how inhu
mane it may seem, we are in
such a position that our
hands are tied we cannot
give aid of this sort without
unwittingly bolstering, to
some degree, the basis of a
government committed to
our suppression, if not de
struction.

Applauds Gleason
Jim Gleason. Republican
candidate for U. S. Senator,
won a victory of his own
which emanated from the
admiration and respect of
Maryland Republicans every
where who entrusted to him
their vote of confidence at
the polls on primary day. His
valiant campaign, against
heavy odds at the outset—
tabulating near 50-50 results
as the returns poured in to
the very last—leaves no
doubt in the minds of his
thousands of supporters that
Mr. Gleason has indeed left
his mark in our State.
I was but one of the volun
teers on his staff who had
the privilege of working
closely with Mr. Gleason
throughout his spirited cam
paign against the Republican
“State Organization” who in
dorsed his chief opponent.
His determination to preserve
the rights of all Republican
voters in our State to choose
a candidate themselves, in an
un-indorsed, open primary
for a truly free election, war
rants serious consideration
in the future.
Throughout his entire cam
paign. Jim Gleason fought
unceasingly for the high
principles he so aptly es
poused and which were self
evident in the manner in
which he conducted his cam
paign. His firm stands in
the vitally important issues

of our day proved him to be
a statesman among politi
cians—one who feared not to
stand up and be counted. His
ability, integrity, loyalty and
allegiance to our party and
our country have made a
lasting impression on all
Marylanders who followed
his political career with in
terest and enthusiasm. To
many, the primary election
was but an overture of bet
ter things to come for the
much-admired Mr. Gleason.
Republicans the State over
should be justly proud of
him for the much-needed
fighting spirit he infused
into our party. We cannot*
afford to lose him the next
time.

Good Deed
My family would like to
share a very pleasant experi
ence with Star readers.
While driving recently in
Maryland, north of Balti
more, a tire blew out. After
driving off the road, a truck
with flashing red lights and
two mechanics aboard sud
denly arrived on the scene.
The men went right to work,
using their own tools and
equipment, and changed our
tire. When the work was
done they presented us with
a litter bag, a road map and
a card which identified them
as members of Susquehanna
Trail Post 10,048, Veterans of
Foreign Wars. In five minutes
we resumed our trip and
they were on their way to
help other distressed motor
ists. The courtesy vehicle was
equipped with gasoline, oil,
compressed air, hydraulic
jack, tools and first-aid
equipment. There was no
charge, just a friendly wish
for a pleasant trip.
The world is in short sup
ply of such courtesies and we
believe Americans should en
courage and nurture them.
We are appreciative of this
worthy project.

'Right-Wingers'
I was amused at the cap
tion describing the tenor of
speeches made at the recent
Democratic Women’s Con
ference, “Democrats Say Re
publicans Becoming More
Right Wing.” As an ex-
Democrat who is now an ac
tive Republican party work
er. I think the definition of
“right-winger” depends upon
the position between the
poles from where the term
emanates. The Democrats’
viewpoint exists because they
have “progressed” so far to
the left ... so far that any
thing contrary to ADA belief
is considered “right wing.”
On second throught, the
caption isn’t so amusing. If
belief in a sound economy,
individual responsibility and
free enterprise rates the label
of “right-winger” then all
Americans who love their
country and their freedom
can entertain only the most
sobering thoughts.

'Too Many People'
In your editorial, “Too Many
People,” you wish “good luck
to our Children as they get
ready to take over the world.”
Near the end you speak of a
world that is worried about
the runaway growth of its
population. Are these the
best words you can offer as a
solution to this mounting ca
tastrophe?
You have missed a clear
opportunity to speak a strong
word urging a rational pro
gram of birth control as a
means of dealing effectively
with this situation. •

Laos 'Lost'
The events which recently
transpired in Southeast Asia
manifest, even to the least
discerning eye, an essential
and oft-recurring failure of
American foreign policy:
namely, failure to determine
the real, paramount enemy in
a given situation.
It can be said with no little
veracity that the enemy in
Laos was communism. A
Communist force of rebel
Laotians copiously augmented
by Red Chinese and North
Vietnamese troops, not to
mention Russian planes, un
dertook full-scale military
operations and conquered the
country.
Yet, our State Department
had pinpointed a totally dif
ferent enemy—poverty and
indifference. To establish
progressive economic trends
and expel native Insouciance,
, a “united front"" government
composed of Communist,
neutralist, and pro-Western
elements was proposed. The
prospect of a temporary peace
nothwithstanding, the perils
inherent in such a govern
ment are multitudinous, not
the least of which being the
legalizing of the Communist
rebel troops. History, whose
voice is so often ignored, in
dicates that such govern
ments move Inexorably to
ward the Communist sphere,
usually at a predictable rate.
The Communists really
wanted to see the area re
* main neutral because, as
Averell Harriman put it, “it’s
not an attractive piece of
real estate.” More important,
we were told, the Russians
needed to keep the Chinese
out.
It is doubtful, however,
that poverty brought thou
sands of Communist troops
streaming into all sectors of
Laos; and. it was not indif
ference, but lack of Western
moral find logistical support,
which sent the Laotians flee
ing from their homeland. One
cannot believe that the Rus
sians attempted to keep the
Chinese out by donating to
them Russian aircraft. Laos,
it now appears, was not such
an unattractive place after
all.
Clearly then, there w r ere
two alternatives in Laos: To
support the pro-Western de
fenders of Laos or to obviate
intervention by pledging sup
port only to a coalition gov
ernment, one which the pro-
Westetn Laotians would never
agree to. The latter course
was taken. Laos was lost.

Local Litter-Bugs
At the regular meeting of
the Manor Park Citizens As
sociation on May 14, the fol
lowing resolution was passed:
""Resolved, that this associ
ation direct letters to each of
the local newspapers asking
that they inaugurate an ‘anti
litter’ campaign for the Dis
trict of Columbia similar to
the successful ‘swat the fly’
campaign of many years
ago.”
The citizens of the Dis
trict seem to have grown
quite lax as far as making
any effort toward keeping
their sidewalks clean, and
this is undoubtedly aggra
vated by the large amount of
confections sold in small
packages by stores and rov
ing merchants. Quite often
grass is cut and hedges trim
med and the clippings left
where they fall on the side
walk or in gutters or alleys.
We believe that a campaign
for good citizenship might be
helpful.

G. O. P.'s Tall Hope in Missouri
Many Republicans in Mis
souri are basing their hopes
for victory in the November
senatorial election on a 6-
foot, 7*4-lnch-tall, 35-year
old president of one of Kan
sas City’s largest banks. He
is Crosby Kemper, and his
bank is the City National
Bank and Trust Co. For eight
months this tall young man
has been campaigning all
over the State and has visited
65 counties. First he must
win the senatorial nomina
tion in a primary election
August 7. He has four op
ponents, but his own view
and that of more impartial
observers is that he is sure
to win. Then will come the
much more difficult task of
defeating the Democratic
candidate who will be incum
bent Senator Edward V. Long,
former Lieutenant Governor.
Senator Long was appointed
in September, 1960 to fill the
vacancy caused by the death
of the late Thomas C. Hen
nings and in November was
elected to fill out Senator
Henning’s unexpired term. He
hails from Clarksville, a
lawyer and no stranger to
politics, having served in
the Missouri legislature and
won election as Lieutenant
Governor in 1956.
Capturing a United States
Senate seat in Missouri is
not an impossible task for
the Republicans. But it is
a tough one. The State is
generally considered Demo
cratic today. Nevertheless,
in 1950, a dozen years ago,
two Republicans from Mis
souri sat in the Senate. The
last one to be defeated for
re-election was Senator
James Preston Kem, who lost
to Democratic Senator Stuart
Symington. If the G. O. P.
succeeds in the coming sen
atorial election, the line will
be “from Kem to Kemper.”
Dislikes Democratic Program
Mr. Kemper was formerly
a Democrat treasurer, in
deed, for Senator Syming
ton’s successful campaign for
re-election in 1958. It wasn’t
long after that, however,
that he decided he could
could not go along with the
New Deal and Fair Deal tenets
of the majority wing of the
Democratic Party. He likes
the Kennedy New Frontier
programs even less. A grand
father, he was for some time
time Democratic National
Committeeman for Missouri.
His father and an uncle—
who heads another success
ful bank in Kansas City
are both Democrats, although
his father, also Crosby Kem
per, is backing Mr. Kemper
in his present try for the
Senate.
Mr. Kemper, in his trav
els about the State, is ap
pealing to both Democrats
and Republicans for support.

VISTAS IN SCIENCE
By THOMAS R. HENRY
Facets of Space Exploring Program
A cubic inch of the stuff
that forms the nuclei of
atoms would weigh about
1 billion tons.
Four basic forces hold cre
ation together. Men are fa
miliar with two of them—
gravity and magnetism. They
are puny forces Indeed com
pared to the mighty and still
mysterious “nuclear force”
that binds protons and neu
trons down in the ultimate
depths of matter.
The basic mechanisms and
origin of all these forces re
main essentially unknown.
They must be accepted as
part of the basic scheme of
things as they are. Prospects
of studying them on a big
scale are just now opening
with the space exploration
program of the scientists of
the Goddard Space Flight
Center of the National Aero
nautics and Space Adminis
tration.
Considerably more is
known, up to now, of electro
magnetic forces which hold
electrons in their planetary
positions in atoms. They are
less than 100th as strong as
the nuclear forces. There is
a so - called Fermi force,
named for the great Italian
physicist, which is about half
way between electromagne
tism and gravity and which,
at present, enters very little
into space calculations.
Gravity’s Force Puny
Best known to man is
gravity the attraction be
tween masses, that which
causes an apple to fall, that
which keeps earth and plan
ets in their places, which
would appear to be the su
preme law of the physical
universe. Actually, some of
the calculationshy space sci
entists show, it is relatively
a very puny force indeed.
The actual weakness of
gravity is easily illustrated.
A chunk of iron weighs 3
pounds. That is equivalent
to saying that the entire
earth pulls on it with a total
force of 3 pounds. The
same force is exerted by a
quite small magnet. It will
keep the iron from falling.
There is no reason, how
ever, to discount this rela
tively puny gravity. That of
the earth, for example, pulls
on the moon with a total
average force of about 22
quadrillion tons. It holds
the moon in its orbit as
well as causing an apple
to fall. The earth’s gravita
tional field also holds the
of a Republican Congress as
a check on the policies and
programs of the Kennedy ad
ministration. ""I’m against
the socialistic power state
which the President and his
programs will surely bring to
this country,” he tells the
people. Then he attacks in
detail much of the legisla
tion which the administra
tion is sponsoring, and also
its big spending programs.
The towering young Sen
ate candidate is a good mix
er and speaker—an attrac
tive personality. A graduate
of the University of Missouri,
he served in the Navy (he
enlisted as soon as he
reached enlistment age) dur
ing the last two years of the
Second World War. He is
married, and his wife, he con
fides, is a Republican. They
have three children.
Strong Support Ready
During his eight months of
campaigning, Mr. Kemper
has been building an organ
ization. If he wins the nom
ination, as now is confi
dently expected, he will have
strong support of the Repub
lican Senatorial Campaign
Committee and also of the
Republican National Com
mittee. In 1960, President
Kennedy just squeaked
through in Missouri, carry
ing the State by a scant
10,000 votes over former Vice
President Nixon. This despite
all that former President
Harry S. Truman could do.
However, the Democrats
elected a Governor that year
—John M. Dalton—by a very
material vote, And Senator
Long was elected with a lead
of 119,000 votes over his Re
publican opponent.
The Democrats are pre
dicting the re-election of
Senator Long. His is not a
seat they regard as in any
real jeopardy. Furthermore,
they would hate to lose it.
He will have the backing of
the Democratic organization.
However, Mr. Kemper comes
of an old, influential family
in Kansas City at the west
ern side of the State and the
Republicans have been pick
ing up strength in St. Louis
at the eastern side. Mr. Kem
per feels he will do well in
that area.
Breaking the Democratic
hold in Missouri, if the Ken
nedy administration is riding
high when November rolls
around, will be no easy task.
At present the State has a
Democratic Governor, two
Democratic Senators and
nine Democrats to two Re
publicans in its congressional

satellites in their orbits.
They can be considered only
as artificial moons.
There is considerably less
common experience with
magnetic forces. The mag
netic field of the earth,
which is believed to be
created by electric currents
circulating deep in the core
of the earth, has much the
same shape as that of a toy
btir magnet. Presumably the
same holds throughout na
ture. The behavior of satel
lites launched by the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space
Administration is expected
to make possible mapping of
these fields.
Finally, electric charges
give rise to electric force
fields, similar to magnetic
fields, in the regions of space
surrounding them. Little is
known, to date, of their
significance.
Nuclear Forces Different
The extremely powerful
nuclear forces are something
quite different. With them
many can have no direct sen
sory experience and the
physicist can investigate
them only to a quite lim
ited extent in the laboratory.
They come into play .in the
innermost heart of the atom,
in the explosions of atomic
nuclei such as will be found
in the dreaded nuclear bomb
of predicted future wars which
would eliminate mankind,
and in production of most
of the radiant energy of the
sun and stars. The enormous
destructive power calculated
for the bombs is not surpris
ing when the force involved is
considered.
It is an interplay between
the very weak and very
strong forces in nature that
is responsible for the birth
and evolution of the stars
and galaxies. In experiments
now projected at the God
dard Research Center it may
well be possible to make di
rect observations of these
interactions. Satellites may
be sent into regions of space

""IKE'S WARNING ON POWER GRAB""
""THREAT OF BIG GOVERNMENT & PRESIDENT""
WASHINGTON
Pink and healthy, former President Eisenhower came
back to town yesterday with a nostalgic gleam in his eye
and a warning against the growing power of the execu
tive branch of government, particularly under John F.
Kennedy.
The warning ran true to the form of the eight Eisen
hower years. The nostalgia was what was interesting.
""Tell us,"" a reporter asked, ""how you are finding
life in retirement now. Do you sometimes feel that you'd
like to be back in the White House taking up the burdens
there? I know you are very busy. . ..""
""Well, I'm very busy, that's correct,"" replied the
retired five-star general. Then the famous Eisenhower
brow went into its furrow. ""But I have mixeti/feelings.
I think each of us has his portion of ego and his confi
dence that he could do some of these things pretty well,
and I will say this—at least one night I dreamed that
the Twenty-second Amendment (barring a third term)
had been repealed (pause for laughter) and it wasn t wholly
a nightmare""—more laughter.
The furrow smoothed and the grin flashed.
* * *
*lt has long been my judgment that the real threat
to liberty in this republic will come not from any sudden,
calculated onslaught. Rather, the threat to our liberties
will be primarily found in a steady erosion of self-reliant
citizenship, and in excessive power concentration resulting
from the lodging of more and more decisions in an ever
growing Federal bureaucracy,"" Gen Eisenhower said. He
cited the following as evidence:
The President's request for executive power to modify
income taxes at times; his proposal that the executive have
authority ""to finance . . . large-scale emergency public
works by diversion of funds dedicated to other purposes,""
the Administration request for ""sweeping and repressive""
authority over agriculture; the proposal for a Department
of Urban Affairs, which would take over ""a whole host
of state and local responsibilities,"" and the proposal ""to
dilute the independence of the Federal Reserve Board by
Presidential appointment of its chairman.""
Twist
(Continued from Back Page)
The former President answered his own doubts in
his Kansas speech by saying: ""We are about to see a
Renaissance in American pride in America.""
In many ways that renaissance has already begun.
It comes not frum mere nationalist pride but pride in
what the country stands for. What was wrong was a case
of power corrupting—or more properly materialism cor
rupting. And the correction that has now begun is of
the best kind—self-correction.
* * •
Despite the spread of salacious literature and Holly
wood's attempt to sell the most smirksome titillation,
there is a countertide now running. Young college stu
dents have begun to criticize the commercialization of
sex. New ventures in the erotic magazine field have
been mercilessly panned by the ""sophisticates"" to whom
they were supposed to appeal.
* * *
Made aware of the danger* Americans put behind
them the excesses of monopoly, city bossism, speak-easy
living, Isolationism, and McCarthyism. They are now
struggling to control labor union monopolism, gangsterism,
new forms of government corruption, false advertising,
structural unemployment caused* by automation, and de
linquency caused by the wrenching of family life in a
world changed almost overnight from placid rural to
frantic megalopolis, from personal craftsmanship to dis
embodied IBM robotry.

Fight Over Debt Limit
By ROBERT K. WALSH
Stets BUtt Writer
Democratic leaders decided to make a fight in the House
today for the S3OB billion temporary debt limit requested by the
administration, but indicated they might have to settle for a
lower ceiling.
Because of four hours of scheduled debate and other busi
ness this afternoon, a final vote might be delayed until tomorrow
on the administration-support
ed bill and a Republican substi
tute that would fix the limit at
$306 billion from July 1 to next
April 1.
Await MiUB View
The House awaited a state
ment which Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Mills.
Democrat of Arkansas, planned
to make at the start of debate.
Mr. Mills, who conferred late
yesterday with President Ken
nedy on the debt limit and
other fiscal matters, had not
disclosed whether he would
stand by the 1308 billion pro
posal or accept the $306 billion
figure.
His eventual decision seemed
likely to carry considerable
weight with some Democrats
who indicated coolness to the
S3OB billion request.
Mr. Mills said earlier yes
terday at a Rules Committee
hearing that he might accept
a $306 billion limit as provided
lin the Republican bill if closer
'study and consultations con-'
1 vlnced him it would allow flexi
bility in debt management op-
I erations.
Inclined to Accept
Rather than risk defeat of
I the administration bill and per
haps rejection of any increase
in the temporary limit of the
public debt, Mr. Mills was be
lieved inclined to accept the
$306 billion figure.
Republicans claimed suffi
cient Democratic support to
reject the Ways and Means
Committee’s bill that would in-
Judge Indicted
On Tax Charges
AUSTIN. Tex., June 13 (AP).
—Judge Woodrow Bean of El
Paso County was indicted by a
Federal grand jury yesterday
for failing to file income tax
returns.
Judge Bean, defeated June 2
in a runoff for the Democratic
nomination for Congressman
at large, acknowledged during
the campaign that he had not
reported his income to the
Government. He said amounts
withheld from his salary more
than covered what he owed,
however.
Asserting the income tax was
unconstitutional, Judge Bean
said April 30 he had been un
able to get Federal authorities
to file a test case.
The 44-year-old judge declined
comment on the indictments
charging willful failure to file
returns for 1956 through 1960
on total income of $53,296.58,

crease the present S3OO billion
temporary limit to S3OB billion
from July 1 to next March 31.
The Republican bill would
lower the temporary debt limit
to $305 billion from April 1
to June 24 and then to S3OO
' billion from that date until the
end of the 1963 fiscal year
i June 30.
There still was some ques
' tion, however, whether enough
Democrats would vote for the
Republican substitute to set a
- lower sliding scale limit.
Treasury Secretary Dillon was
asked by reporters yesterday
whether he thought a $306 bil
lion limit would be too tight
l for meeting fiscal obligations
during the seasonal debt peak
' period. He replied that it
' would be “tight enough to bring
Congress back” in November or
December to boost- the debt
1 ceiling again. The actual debt
' stands at about $294 billion and
I will exceed S3OO billion in July.

Kefauver Raps
'Massacre' of
Drug Measure
The Senate Judiciary Com
mittee is going ahead with its
overhaul of a drug Industry
regulatory measure over the
bitter protests of its sponsor.
Senator Kefauverf Democrat of
Tennessee.
“The massacre of a good bill
is continuing, and I expect to
fight it all the way.” Senator
Kefauver told reporters after a
closed committee session yes
terday.
However, six amendments
written into the measure by
the committee were described
by representatives of the Wel
fare Department as substan
tially in line with President
Kennedy’s recommendations to
Congress.
Row on Senate Floor
The controversy over the bill
erupted in a row on the Senate
floor Monday when Senator
Kefauver said a committee ma
jority appeared to have sur
rendered to the wishes of drug
manufacturers.
While Senator Kefauver con-
tended the measure was being
rendered ineffective, supporters
said the changes were designed
to produce legislation that had
a chance of passage.
Amendments adopted yester
day would (1) require registra
tion of drug manufacturers and
provide for factory inspections
and quality controls, (2) bar
the marketing of new drugs
until their efficacy as well as
their safety had been estab-
and (3) give the Gov
ernment authority to order the
withdrawal of drugs if new evi
dence brought their safety into
question.
A spokesman for the Welfare
Department described all these
provisions as “pretty good steps
forward and certainly no step
backward.”
Change Licensing Proposal
The amendments were
adopted by votes of 9-5 and
9-3.
Senator Eastland, Democrat
of Mississippi, the committee
chairman, said he thought the
work of hammering out the
compromise measure was near
ly completed.
The registration section
adopted by the committee re
places Senator Kefauver’s orig
inal proposal for Government
licensing of drug manufactur
ers.
All drug manufacturers
would be required to register
with the Welfare Department,
listing their plants, and would
be subject to inspection at
least once every two years. *
The second amendment
would empower Federal agents
to enter factories or warehouses
in which food, drugs or cos
metics are manufactured, proc
essed or held for Inspection pur
poses.
However, the amendment
would -provide that inspection
shall not extend to financial,
sales or pricing data or to any
thing related to research ac
tivity.
The third amendment, aimed
at assuring quality and purity.l
would declare a drug to be
adulterated if it were not
manufactured in accordance
with approved standards.

I
MAN to MAN
as an Army
Recruiter, I
•pend a lot of
time telling
people about
the Army
guarantee.
That's because
I consider it
the best deal
a young man
can get anywhere, »o far aa hi*
military obligation is concerned.
I usually explain, first of all, that
the Army’s guarantee isn’t just a
figure of speech or some sort of
slogan. It’s an actual guaran
tee, and it’s in writing. What’s
it good for? The Army guaran
tee is your assurance that you’ll
get the training you want and
qualify for before you enlist.
First you aake your choice,
from more than 400 jobs in
which the Army offers training.
Then you take the qualifying
tests, to make sure you have the
aptitude required for the train
ing you pick. All this involves
no obligation at all on your part.
If you don’t qualify, you don’t
have to enlist. Or you can pick
a second cnoice, and quawy ior
that. Either way, once you
qualify, you get the guarantee.
And it all happens before you
enlist. It doesn’t apply, though,
if you wait till you’re drafted.
You have to enlist to get your
training guaranteed.
Weather
Outlook....
Hot weather with adequate
moisture for most crop pur
poses is forecast for the Mis
souri Bootheel, Arkansas,
West Tennessee, North and
| Central Mis.f ssip^i and tne
Louisiana Delta.
Rainfall will occur as scat
tered shower periods, thickest
early in the month and again
a little later after mid-June.
A fairly dry period is likely
towards the end of June and
irrigation will become a fac
tor again in many sections
during July. Each farm or
town is expected to receive
rain on 8 to 10 days during
June. Rain will total 3 to 5
inches in the Louisiana Delta,
South Arkansas, and North
and Central Mis4issippi. It
will total 4 to 6 inches in

DELTA COUNCIL
PUSHES CHANGE
Stoneville, Miss., June 1 -
Recognition was given at the
Delta Council Annual Meeting
on May 24 to the concurrent
resolution to amend the Mis
sissippi Constitution, passed
overwhelmingly by the Mis
sissippi Legislature.
The proposed amendment
will make possible the separa
tion of the office of Sheriff
and Tax Collector and will
provide that each may suc
ceed himself when the offices
are separated.
Delta Council directors and
members passed a resolution
at the Annual Meeting point
ing out that the intent of the
proposed amendment was to
promote economy in govern
ment and more efficient law
enforcement. The Council
commended the proposition
for study and full considera
tion by its membership and
the voters of the 18 Delta and
part - Delta counties.
Tne concurrent resolution
was authorized by Senator W.
B. Alexander of Cleveland. It
has been endorsed by a num
oer oi organizations including
the Mississippi Economic
the month.
Temperatures will be a lit
tle above normal for June.
This means afternoon read
ings wiill average in the low to
mid 90s with a few days near
the 100 degree mark towards
the end of the month. Night
time low readings w\ll ave
rage in the high 60 to low 70
degree bracket. Soil tempera
tures in the top few inches
of the ground will average in
the high 70 to low 80 degree
range.
Low pressure aloft moved
into the southern plains states
on the last of May and the
first part of June giving an
end to the drought that oc
cured during most of May.
This low pressure - rain mak
ing disturbance - is forecast
to remain over the Southern
Rockies during June and will
generate surface low pressure
systems in Colorado and New
Mexico which will move
across the central plains, nor
th of the Mid-South area, on
into the Great Lakes area.
Rain in the Mid-South will
occur as these systems move
just north of the area.
Sunshine will prevail two
thirds of the daylight hours
in June. Evaporation will to
tal over 6 inches. Clay soils
will be open for mechanical
operations 80 percent of the
time and sandy soils will be
open on all but 3 or 4 days
during June.
Council and by numerous
state leaders.
The chairman of the Heush
Constitution Committee, Re
presentative Maurice Black of
Carrollton has urged adop
tion of the proposed amend
ment that will be voted on
rune 5 and issued the follow-1
ng statement clarifying what
s and is not involved in the
imendment.
""First, the amendment nei
her adds to or detracts from
the present authority of the
legislature to fix the fees and
salaries of all county offices,
including sheriffs.
""Second, the amendment
In itself does not separate the
office of Sheriff from that of
Tax Collector.
""Third, the amendment nei
ther adds to nor detracts
from the authority of the
legislature to separate or
combine the offices of Sheriff
and Tax Collector and does
not affect the authority of the
legislature to either combine
or separate such offices on a
reasonable classification ba
sis.
“The amendment makes on
ly one substantial change in
the constitution. It permits
a Sheriff to succeed himself
in office if the legislature sees
fit to separate such offices.
“The Sheriff who knows
that he is eligible to succeed
himself in office will be en
couraged to better prepare
himself for his duties, and de

Question: “What is the Breeches Bible?”
Answer: This was a popular nickname given to
the Bible the official name of which was the Geneva
Bible. It was the first English edition which intro
duced the numbering of verses, and was first published
as a whole at Geneva in 1560.
It was called the Breeches Bible because of the
translation of Genesis 3:7.
“they sewed fig leaves together
and made themselves aprons.’’
In the Geneva Bible the word
“breeches” was used instead of
“aprons.”
•• • *
Question: “Will you please
tell me what I can find in the
Bible concerning the unwed
mother or the illegitimate
child?”
. Answer: The development of
the Hebrew moral code and
then its later interpretation in
the light of Christian teaching
offers a wide variety. There
was always a strict morality
requiring marriage or something
equivalent to it, even in the
times when polygamy was rec
ognized.
In ancient times the differ
ence between a wife and a
concubine was based upon the
previous social status of the
Woman.
; The best answer is to be
found In a good standard dic
tionary of the Bible under the
heading “marriage.” You will
find it in your public library.

Question: “Where can I find
the meaning of the letters IHS
on the top of the crucifix or
on the vestments of priests?”
Answer: These letters form a
monogram taken from the first
three letters of the word Jesus
as they appear in the Latin
text of Luke 6:5 of a sth cen
tury Greek-Latin manuscript of
the Gospels known as the ""Co
dex Bezae.” This particular
manuscript was presented to

Balks Court Criticism
By CASPAR NANNES
BUr SUM Writer ,
DETROIT, June 30. The
new Lutheran Church in Amer- ;
lea refused yesterday to vote :
on a resolution criticizing the i
Supreme Court decision ban- ]
ning prayer in public schools.
The statement expressed |
regret that the Supreme Court ,
had ruled “a noncompulsory,
a nonsectarian prayer in the
public schools to be a viola
tion of the First Amendment.'*
“Recognition of God,” the ,
resolution said, “has been ac- ■
iceptable to the great majority j
of the people of the United
States” since our country's be
ginnings and “those nations ;
and persons who rely solely on ,
their own strength are deluded.
and are doomed to destruction.""
The delegates voted. 642-to
-140, to refer the resolution to 1
the executive council for “any 1
action it may wish to take.” '
The delegates maintain that
the denomination established 1

Eastland Proposes
Amendment on Prayer
By the Associated Press
Senator Eastland, Democrat
of Mississippi, has proposed a
constitutional amendment de
signed to “completely nullify
both the effect and implica
tion” of the Supreme Court de
cision on public school prayer.
The court’s decision, said
Senator Eastland, might create
in the minds of children “the
fixed impression that the act
of praying to God is in itself
unconstitutional wherever the
prayer might be uttered.”
The two-part amendment, in
troduced yesterday, is aimed not
only at the decision barring
official public school prayers,
but also at a ruling concerning
the mailing as obscene litera
ture.
The second goal of the
amendment is to alleviate in

Joint Study Asked
Delegates here yesterday ap
proved a motion inviting the
Lutheran C h u r c h-Missouri
Synod and the American Lu
theran Church to conduct a
joint study with the Lutheran
Church, in America on the
theology of confirmation.
This would include a revolu
tionary proposal that baptized
children, 10 years old and over,
may be admitted to holy com
munion before they are con
firmed. The concept that con
firmation should no longer be
regarded as essential for ad
mission to holy communion is
a radical departure from pres
ent Lutheran procedure, which
insists upon the former as a
requirement for the latter.
The convention will close
tomorrow when the newly
elected officers are installed.

NOT THE STAR'
First Lady Shares Acclaim
By FRANCES LEWINE
Associated Press Staff Writer
MEXICO CITY, June 30.
Jacqueline Kennedy wasn’t
the star of the state visit
this time, but she basked in
the warm friendship and
colorful welcome Mexicans
gave President Kennedy—
and had her modest share,
too.
In contrast to the acclaim
Mrs. Kennedy herself has re
ceived on her own and in
state visits with Mr. Kennedy
to other capitals, she was be
ing played down here.
There were no pictures of
her in the streets of Mexico
City. Only one big sign was
seen welcoming The Presi
dent “and Jacqueline.”
There were some shouts of
“Viva Jackie” as she rode in
a closed car with Mrs. Eva
Lopez Mateos while Mr. Ken
nedy and Mexican President
Adolfo Lopez Mateos took the
bows standing in an open
car on the 13-mile parade
route into the city.
Youngsters did run after
Mrs. Kennedy’s motorcar as
it swept around the Zocalo,
the square near the National
Palace, and swung into the
next block for a late after
noon visit to the National
Museum of Anthropology.
Mrs. Kennedy had a few
especially enthusiastic fans.
An American girl, Tina
French of Boston, waved a
hand-printed ""Viva Jackie”
sign at the entrance to Los
Pinos, the Mexican Presi
dent’s oficial residence which
was the first stop on the
Kennedy intinerary.
A few youths rushed up
with an oil painting likeness
of the First Lady and placed
it on an easel outside the

Federation Installs,
Scatters to Homes
By RUTH DEAN
Star Staff Writer
Delegates to the 71st an
nual convention of the Gen
eral Federation of Women’s
Clubs were on their way
home today after concluding
their week-long session in
the Sheraton Park Hotel with
installation of new officers.
Last night’s installation
ceremony officially put the
cloak of office on the federa
tion’s new dynamic presi
dent, Mrs. Dexter Otis Arnold
of Concord, N. H., who at 48
is also the youngest woman
ever to have held that post.
It also brought to an end
a colorful evening; which be
gan with the singing of Met
ropolitan Opera star Rise
Stevens in a program of fav
orites which included two
from her famed “Carmen”
role.
Dr. Charles S. Cameron,
president of the Hahnemann
Medical College and Hospital
of Philadelphia gave the
evening’s principal address—
an inspirational speech in
which he called on the club
women to exercise Individual
responsibility in meeting to
day’s social ills both on th?
home front and abroad.
Critical of Shift
Dr. Cameron attacked the
trend toward shifting of in
dividual responsibility for
charity to government, de
claring that in such a system
“our charity takes the form of
taxes.”
The same shifting of re
sponsibility and withdrawal
from personal involvement.
Dr. Cameron noted in the
trend toward pooling private
contributions to charity in a
once-a-year donation to the
United Fund which “now can
relieve us from repeated calls
for help and assure us we
won’t be bothered any more.
You don’t even have to know'
what agencies you are help
ing-just wtite the check.""
Charity only counts, Dr.

By EVELYN M. DENT
Contributing Writer
The Air Staff and com
manders entertained Gen.
and Mrs. Frederic Harrison
Smith at dinner at the Offi
cers Club, Bolling Air Force
Base last night, and they
turned out 300 strong to bid
the popular Air Force couple
good luck and fair skies.
The ballroom had been
transformed into a veritable
Versailles garden. Bouquets
of flowers on tall taper-like
stands alternated with tradi
tional low ones as table cen
terpieces.
Lt. Smith 3d flew in from
Ramstein Air Base, Ger
many, to be at the dinner
for his parents. He escorted
Miss Jean Strother, daugh
ter of Lt. Gen. and Mrs.
Dean C. Strother, who also
attended. James Smith could
not make it. He is in Eng
land.
Brig. Gen. and Mrs. George
H. Krieger were telling
friends of their coming de
parture for Hawaii. They
have had the Smith’s young
est son, Janvier, as an over
night visitor.
Lt. Gen. and Mrs. Troup
Miller came from Maxwell
Air Force Base, Ala. He is
commander of the Air Uni
versity. They were dinner
companions of Maj. Gen. and
Mrs. John Carpenter, and
Maj. Gen. William H. Wise
of Colorado Springs, Colo.
Also in the company were
Gen. Emmett ODonnell, Jr.,
Hawaii, Gen. Laurence Kuter
and Lt. Gen. John K. Ger
hart, who was there with
Mrs. Gerhart. Gen. and Mrs.
William F. McKee came
from Dayton, Ohio. He takes

Is. I’m glad we’ve answered
that challenge the speaker
gave us.”
Cabinet Installed
After a parting speech of
tribute to the retiring presi
dent. Mrs. E. Lee Ozbim of
Oklahoma City, Okla., Mrs.
Houghton installed the new
officers in Mrs. Arnold's
cabinet.
Mrs. LaFell Dickinson, also
a past president, installed*
the new president. It marked
two firsts she noted—“the
first time in my memory that
a new president of the Gen
eral Federation has been
young enough to have both
parents present to witness
her installation, and the first
time a General Federation
president has had the priv
ilege of being installed by an
honorary president from her
own State.”
Mrs. Arnold’s parents. Dr.
and Mrs. S. Burman Long of ’
Worcester, Mass., were in last
night's audience as were her
husband and her sister and
brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs.
John Glendening of Pelham
Manor, N. Y., and their three
children.
Coming down from New
Hampshire especially for the
ceremony were the State's
Gov. Wesley Powell and Con
cord’s Mayor Charles Davie.
Smith were the Air Force
Chief of Staff Gen. Curtis E.
LeMay and Mrs. LeMay, Gen.
and Mrs. Carl Spaatz, Gen.
and Mrs. Nathan F. Twining,
Gen. and Mrs. Thomas D.
White and Maj. Gen. Ter
ence O. Finnegan, chief of
the Air Force chaplains, ac
companied by his sister. Miss
Isabelle Finnegan.
Col. Willis L. Helmantoler
came from Randolph Air
Force Base, San Antonio,
Tex., to be master of cere
monies. The Air Force Sing
ing Strings were at their
brilliant best and the Singing
Sergeants almost stopped the
proceedings.
In his remarks, Gen:
Spaatz observed that “Freddy
Smith,” after 37 years of
service, had joined the ranks
of the GAR (grand army of
the retired), having served
with the highest degree of
devotion typical of the West
Point Motto: Duty, Honor,
Country.
Gen. Twining said in part
that the time had come to
fix the trouble with Gen.
Smith’s golfing back swing.
Gen. White capped the
welcome to the retired ranks
by saying, “What away to
close the fiscal year, what a
loss to the Air Force,” that
Gen. Smith at 54 (his birth
day is today) could now fix
leaks in the gutters and go
fishing to his heart’s content.
The Assistant Vice Chief
of Staff, Maj. Gen. Richard
M. Montgomery, presented a
magnificent Steuben Glass
shallow bowl mounted on a
fluted stand to Gen. and
Mrs. Smith together with an
inscribed plaque “with affec
tion and highest esteem from
the Air Staff and Com
manders.”
Secretary Zuckert said in
part, “Friends of Martha and
Freddy, my remarks are most
inadequate after the alumni
have given their commercials,
gardeners, fishermen, golfers,
et al. It’s hard to match
their tributes. I will not try.
I’ve known them but 16
years.”
Col. Helmantoler then read
a telegram received from
President Kennedy in Mexico.
It said: “To Gen. Frederick H.
Smith, jr„ United States Air
Force Vice Chief of Staff,
Washington, D. C.
“I express the gratitude of
the Nation, and my own per
sonal appreciation for your
long service in defense of a
free America. Your honorable
and unselfish service to this
end exemplifies your honor
and dedication and self sacri
fice of the members of our
military force. I join those
close friends honoring you
tonight in expressing our best
wishes for the future.”

Rules Unit Backs Probe
Os Foreign Lobbying
By the Associated Press
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee won Rules
Committee backing today for an investigation into attempts
of foreign-paid lobbyists to influence United States in favor
of “highly questionable programs.”
The Rules Committee, headed by Senator Mansfield,
Democrat of Montana, Senate Majority Leader, approved the
foreign relations group's re
quest for $50,000 to finance a
year-long inquiry.
Senator Fulbright. Democrat
of Arkansas. Foreign Relations
Committee chairman, said Con
gress must act before vital
United States policy interests |
""become tangled in webs of
domestic lobbying prompted
and paid for by foreign inter
ests.”
The Rules Committee's action
sent the investigative resolu
tion to the Senate for formal
approval. The investigation is
designed to cover all efforts by
non-diplomatic agents for for
eign governments to ""influence
United States policies.”
Sugar Lobbying Extensive
The proposed inquiry stems
from efforts of agents for
foreign governments to influ
ence the amounts of quotas in
this year's sugar extension bill.
Congressional figures indi
cate the sugar lobbyists- were
paid a total of more than $500,-
000 by their foreign govern
ment clients.
The committee said it would
like to look into the whole,
recent trend “which has seen
public relations firms, economic!
advisers, law firms and con
sultants” retained by foreign
governments for purposes
Estes Got Allotments
Despite Hints of Abuse
By CECIL HOLLAND .
Star Staff Writer
Senate investigate!* received
testimony today that transfer!
of hundreds of acres of cotton!
allotments to Billie Sol Estes
was approved after farm of
ficials in Texas were alerted
that the program was being
abused.
The Texas State Committee
of the Agriculture Stabilization
and Conservation Service, it
was bought out, never passed
on the transfers itself.
The testimony was received
from Baldwin P. Davenport of
Stamford. Tex., a former mem
ber of the State committee.
I Mr. Davenport testified thati
ih late November. 1960, or early |
in 1961, the late Henry H. Mar-j
shall, a key farm official in
Texas, expressed the opinion
that ""the program is being 1
abused.”
Sought Legal Opinion
The witness said Mr. Mar
shall made the observation dur
ing a meeting and said he was
going to ask the Agriculture
Department for a legal opinion
about the Estes cotton allot
ment transfers.
Mr. Davenport was a witness
before the Senate Investiga-1
tions subcommittee looking into'
the cotton dealings of the in
dicted Texas operator.
The subcommittee undertook
to find out the role played by
Mr. Marshall in the Estes mal-

""ranging from legitimate rep
resentation to highly question
able programs designed to in
fluence Government policies di-
I rectly or through the American
i public at large.”
The tempo of such activity,
the committee report said yes
terday, has “increased in al
! most direct proportion to our
Government's growing political,
military and economic commit
-1 ments abroad.”
Plans Jan. 31 Report
Senator Fulbright said the
committee does not contemplate
launching its full-scale Inquiry
until after Congress adjourns,
1 but plans an Interim report no
‘later than January 31.
The committee said its mem- ,
1 bers and staffers have been |
contacted by persons “seeking (
to present an apparently Im- (
partial point of view of a
country or its leader without ,
disclosing that they were being
I paid to represent the country ]
i involved or its leaders.”
i Among other things, the ,
i committee proposes to look into t
: the activities of paid agents to ,
influence increases in military C
l and economic aid for certain
i countries. L
I ter. Mr. Marshall was found
shot to death under mysterious
circumstances on his ranch
near Franklin, Tex., a year ago
last month.
An original verdict of suicide
was returned. The case was re
opened a few weeks ago, but an
investigation by a State grand
| Jury resulted in no change in
the verdict.
MeClellan Voices Doubt
Chairman McClellan, Demo
crat of Arkansas, said he could
not understand how Estes could
receive more than 3,000 acres
of cotton allotments with the
Texas State Committee being
bypassed in the matter.
Mr. Davenport, a Republican,
I who served more than four
years on the State committee
and 13 months as chairman,
said the matter would come be
fore the State committee only
if there was an appeal from the
county level.
The county committee. Mr.
Davenport said, had the re
sponsibility of approving and
checking the allotments.
The subcommittee was told
the transfers were approved in
the State headquarters by an
official who was delegated by
i Mr. Marshall to sign a form
| required in such transfers. This
was a form by which those
transferring the land certified
there were no side agreements
involved.

Senator McClellan, saying
he was confused by Mr. Daven

Mr. Davenport said he didn’t

tioning, said his duties on the
State committee required only
about three days work a month.
His position it was brought out,
was under political patronage,
and he left the committee after
the Kennedy administration
came into office.
Earlier. Senator McClellan
today asked for SIOO,OOO to
finance the subcommittee's in
quiry into the Billie Sol Estes
story.
Senator McClellan received
a friendly welcome when he
made the request before the
Senate Rules and Administra
tion Committee.
Majority Leader Mansfield
of Montana wanted to know
if the requested funds would be
enough to carry on the mas
sive investigation of the in
dicted Pecos (Tex.) operator.
He said he would support a
request for additional funds
if needed “to get this job done.”
The investigation of the Estes
matter has turned out to be
one of the subcommittee’s ma
jor inquiries. At one time Sen
ator McClellan had 46 investi
gators at work on the case, with
most of them in the field in
Texas. Oklahoma and other
States in which Estes operated.
The subcommittee, the chief
investigative arm of the Senate,
previously received $400,000 for
its work for the year.
Jury Acquits
'Doomed' Man
SAN FRANCISCO. July 11
<AP).—After three trials and
two years in Death Row, for
mer teaman Robert Lee Kidd
was acquitted yesterday of
murdering Albert Clarke, an
antique dealer.
Kidd had bitter words after
ward for the time he spent
awaiting execution in the gas
chamber at San Quentin’s
Death Row. for the three trials,
and for law authorities.
“That was hell, seeing men
go to their death,” he said.
Asked what his plans were,
the 39-year-old former mer

U. S. Space Exploration
Success, Kennedy Says
By the Associated Press
President Kennedy today
hailed recent United States
space accomplishments and said
they have laid a substantial
foundation for greater future
successes.
Mr. Kennedy made the com
ment in sending Congress a re
port on the activities of the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration from October,
1960, through June, 1961.
Since that period, Mr. Ken
nedy said. NASA, in co-opera
tion with other agencies of the
Government, “has made sub
stanial strides toward meeting
our new and more ambitious
aeronautics and space goals.”
His message was written be
fore the country's latest spec
tacular space venture—the or
biting yesterday of the Telstar
satellite to pave the way for
ocean-spanning live television:
The NASA report was for
warded to Mr. Kennedy by the
agency’s chief. James E. Webb,
who spoke also of mounting
accomplishments since June.
1961.
Weather Information
Byway of example. Mr. Webb
said weather satellites are
providing valuable advance in
formation on storms and that
communications satellite re
search holds promise of less
costly and more efficient com
munications between contin
ents. The report was written
before the successful launch
ing of Telstar yesterday.
Through data from the
flights of American astronauts,
Mr. Webb said, “we are learn
ing how well a man caji pilot
a spacecraft, how he can ad
just to the weightlessness and
other stresses of space and:
what he can observe to add to
the information recorded by
electronic sensors.”
Concluding his letter to the
President, Mr. Webb said:
I “It Is clear that space re
r search will add immeasurably
s to man's knowledge of science.
I technology, his own planet, the
1 universe, and possibly the
:, origin of life itself. The United
States is in the forefront In
■ seeking, obtaining, and dis-
■ seminating this knowledge.”
The Senate, meanwhile, was
! getting set to vote on a new
. $3,802,515,250 space authoriza
| tion measure.
Senator Kerr. Democrat of
■ Oklahoma, almost won Senate
’ passage by voice vote yesterday
with only a handful of Senators
: present, but Senator Proxmire,
> Democrat of Wisconsin, forced
a delay by asking for a record
■ vote on two amendments.
Seeks New Agency
Senator Proxmire urged that
an independent presidential
! commission study the problems
;of scientific manpower. He
' said NASA has had so much to
■ spend it has been raiding other
' Government agencies for scien
- lists.
Senator Proxmire's second
amendment would require
1 NASA to use competitive bid
ding “to the maximum extent
practicable,” with a detailed
■ record by the administrator
when this was not done. He
1 said NASA spending has nearly
doubled each year with no
limits now in sight. Only 9 per
cent was spent under competi
tive biding, Senator Proxmire
said.
The Senate bill would au
thorize $3,749,515 250 for the
fiscal year whicn began July 1
and s7l million for projects
started in the preceding 12
1 months.

THE EXTRA PUSH
Americans Feel 'Cautious Optimism'
About the War in Viet Nam
By RICHARD FRYKLUND
Star Start Writer
The American Army captain
guided his jeep along the dusty road
with one hand and waved with the
other at a Viet Namese family loung
ing outside a hut. The children waved
wildly back and the grown-ups smiled.
“There you see one reason why I’m
beginning to feel optimistic about this
operation,” the captain told his pas
sengers. “At first the people around
here wouldn’t even look at us. Some
times we’d drive through a village,
and we wouldn’t see a single person.
They’d be hiding in their houses.
“Now they accept us. A lot of them
are even friendly.
“But better than that, they seem
to be convinced that we can help give
them security. Moje than 2,000 in
this province have voluntarily left
the Red zone and moved into the
areas the government cleared of
Communists.”
The captain shifted around so he
could see his passengers and summed
up his feelings about the war for
South Viet Nam:
“A month ago I thought our whole
program here was failing. But now
I think it can work.”
Spreading Optimism
This “cautious optimism” has
spread lately among the American
officials who started the “extra push""
last winter to keep this wavering
country from falling behind the Iron
Curtain.
It has been reflected in views ex
pressed by men such as Secretary of
Defense McNamara, returning from
the latest Honolulu conference on
Viet Nam, and Admiral George W.
Anderson, chief of naval operations,
just back from an Asian inspection
tour.
These views are based on progress
reports—by men like this captain—
on the first phase of the new counter
offensive in Viet Nam.
The Americans working in the hin
terlands of Viet Nam say the Com
munists are being pushed back.
The conclusion of top military and
civilian officials on the scene is that
the war of covert aggression in Viet
Nam can be won by the anti-Com
munists.
It should be emphasized that they
say “can."" No one says victory is
sure.
No one knows what the Commu
nists will do next. No one can guar
antee that the Viet Namese govern
ment will remain stable and will do
enough of the right things to carry
the job through for the many years
it probably will take.
But at least the job no longer looks
impossible to the men who are do
ing it.
Signs of Progress
What are the signs of progress?
First, there is the bloody yardstick
of sudden death. Once the Viet Cong
(as the Communist guerrilas call
themselves) had their own way in
killings. Now, however, the govern
ment forces are killing more Viet
Cong soldiers than they are losing.
Also, large areas have been made
""secure” from Communist raiding.
When Gen. Paul D. Harkins, boss
of all American soldiers in Viet Nam
and Thailand, was in Phu Yen Prov
ince recently for a briefing, the head
American adviser in the area, a
eager, young major, showed him a
map that pictures the push-back in
that one difficult province.
Before the new program was
launched, Phu Yen was almost com
pletely in the “red zone” under ef
fective control of the Communists
with extensive mountain areas in the
“black zone” (so infested that gov
ernment troops didn’t even bother
going there) plus some ""blue-zone”

SPECIAL REPORT
Pentagon Reporter Richord Fryklsud, this year's
winner of the Raymond Clapper award, has
jast returned from a far-ranging inspection
of the South Viet Norn front.
areas where the government was at
least battling it out on even terms.
Now There's Yellow
But the map shown Gen. Harkins
after the first 90-day phase of the
push - back in that province intro
duced a new color—a “yellow zone”
that was for all practical purposes
free of Communists.
The yellow zone covered only about
15 per cent of the map, but it in
cluded most of the key towns along
the coast and on the principal rivers.
“By the end of the year most of
the important populated areas of
the province should be in the yellow
zone,” the major told Gen. Harkins.
""The government should be able to
maintain control over one-third of
the province without having to use
regular troops. This will free the
regulars to concentrate on the blue
and red zones.”
The yellow zones are expanding
throughout the country.
As they expand, more and more
of the Viet Namese people living in
those zones have an inducement to
shift their loyalty from the Viet Cong
to the government. American mili
tary advisers with the government
forces say they are shifting their
allegiance.
“It’s not just the fact that the peo
ple are starting to be friendly with
us,” one of these advisers said.
“They’re starting to help us, too.
“The key to the military operation
here is intelligence. The villagers
know everything that the Viet Cong
is doing in this province. If they
tell us, then we can stop the Com
munists from operating.”
Intelligence gathering remains a
major problem, but some useful in
telligence is coming in. Government
troops in Phu Yen and elsewhere in
Viet Nam are carrying out major of
fensive operations almost daily that
depend on information gathered from
people whom the Communists thought
would keep their location a secret.
Friendly Environment
Experts on guerrilla warfare like to
quote the Chinese Communist mas
ter of the art, Mao Tse-tung, who
once said that guerrillas are like the
fish and the people like the water.
The people must provide a friendly
environment or the fish cannot live.
In Viet Nam one side need not de
feat the other in pitched battles in
order to win. Victory can go to the
side that wins over the mass of the
people.
Another encouraging sign is that
the government troops are using
American help more willingly and
more skillfully.
An American Marine Corps colonel
in the rich delta country in the south
of Viet Nam reported to Admiral An
derson that when he first came, he
was supposed to help two Viet Nam
divisions by ferrying troops in heli
copters in raids against the Commu
nists. The local commanders seemed
dubious about the value of the chop
pers, however, and didn’t use them
much.
Now reported the colonel, they are
calling on him regularly, and a third
division nearby is getting as much
helicopter aid as it can squeeze out.
These signs of progress explain the
new optimism over Viet Nam. But
with the word ""optimism” top officials
always put the word ""cautious.” No
one expects the Communists to take

Cuba Prisoner
Deal Rumored
Drug, Food Swap
By Donovan Seen
By MIRIAM OTTENBERG
Star Staff Writer
Reports today swept Cuban
refugee communities in Wash
ington, New York and Miami
that the attorney who negoti
ated the release of U-2 Pilot
Francis Gary Powers is now on
the verge of engineering a
trade of food and medicine for
more than 1,100 Cuban inva
sion prisoners.
The attorney, James B. Don
ovan. refused to confirm or
deny rumors that freeing of
the prisoners is imminent. He
previously had acknowledged
that he has been in touch with
Fidel Castro’s government and.
if necessary, will go to Havana
to enter into direct negotia
tions.
The situation has become
steadily worse for the prisoners
still held since the abortive in
vasion last year. One recently
released man looked as if he
had come out of a wartime
concentration camp.
Humanitarian Appeals
Mr. Donovan’s approach to
the Cuban government has
been based on humanitarian
appeals. He has made the point
that he wants to see what can
be done by the American peo
ple to help the Cuban people.
That’s why the approach has
been an offer of food, med
icine and other essentials des
perately needed by all the
Cuban people. Earlier ap
proaches dealt first with trac
tors and then with cash to
ransom the prisoners.
Mr. Donovan is general coun
sel for the Cuban Families
Committee for Liberation of
Prisoners of War. A committee
of prominent Americans formed
in June to help the Cuban Fam
ilies Committee first aimed at
sponsoring a drive for $62 mil-

30,000 POSTAL CLERKS TO DON
COLORFUL NEW UNIFORMS
Postal clerks will soon be as colorful as a com
memorative stamp. Postmaster General J. Edward Day
announced today.
Sometime before Christmas, he told a postal clerks’
convention in Portland. Oreg., the 30,000 window clerks
in more than 10,000 first and second class post offices
will be issued natty blue uniforms.
Male clerks will have a jacket of Peking blue <the
same now worn by postal truck drivers) with white or
blue shirts and maroon neckties, either bows or four-in
hands.
Woman clerks will have a similar fitted jacket with
a blue or white blouse.
The exact cost of the window dressing program was
not announced, but a spokesman for the department
here said $16.4 million was spent last year on 175.000
uniformed employes. By this yardstick, the additional
uniforms would cost something under $3 million.
A BIG DAY AT THE BEACH
Senate Unit Approves
Stronger Drug Control
Judiciary Group Passes Kennedy Bill;
Industry Backs Curbs at House Hearing
The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved unani
mously a bill recommended by President Kennedy to plaee
tighter controls on the manufacture and sale of drugs.
Senator Kefauver, Democrat of Tennessee, who began
investigating the drug industry a yetr ago, said this bill
“should go a long way toward assuring the American people
that drugs are not only safe,
but will do what is claimed for
them.”
The Senators acted as the
House Commerce Committee
continued hearings on the same
subject.
The Senators acted as the |
House Commerce Committee
heard a spokesman for the
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association ask for stronger
Government regulation of the
industry. At the same time, the
witness warned that the new
rules should be carefully drawn
so they do not cut off the flow
of beneficial new drugs.
Two Goals Cited
Senator Kefauver said the
bill passed by the Senate group
will accomplish two of the three '
goals he had in mind when he
introduced the original bill in
April, 1961, namely, safer drugs
and better information to doc
tors.
His third objective was lower
prices.
The Senator said some pro
visions of this bill will operate
to reduce the prices of non
patented medicine, such as the
authority of the Government to
establish simple generic names
for such drugs.
But he pointed out that 60
i per cent of the medicines in use
are patented and the new bill
I as it came from committee will
not bring down those prices.
Amendments Planned
Senator Kefauver plans, how
jever, to offer two amendments
in the Senate to control prices
of patented drugs.
One amendment would re-
I quire a company to file with its
patent any agreements relating
to assignment of markets or
effecting prices.
The second amendment would
provide that, if after a patent
has been in effect for three
years the Government finds the
price to druggists is 500 per,
cent or more of the factory
cost including research, it could
require the patent-holder to |
license its use to other qualified
applicants upon payment of a |
rayalty of up to 8 per cent.
The provisions of the bill as
reported would:
Require the Food and Drug
i Administration to pass on both
safety and claims for efficacy
of drugs.
Require that advertising show

Brown, Nixon Comps
Haggle on TV Debates
By MARY McGRORY
Star Staff Writer
LOS ANGELES, Calif., Aug.
20. Topic A in the Nixon-
Brown campaign for the gover

television debate.
The television debate is by
now a fixture of the American
political scene. To refuse to
participate is to show the white
feather. And yet to participate,
is. as Richard M. Nixon knows
better than any man, to risk
all in a half-hour under the
Kleig lights.
Mr. Nixon issued the chal

last June. After some thought,
Gov. Brown agreed.
The matter is now in nego

Twelve persons who were ex

a flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil,
have been traced to Washing

Area Combed
By 350 Men
Alexandria police today said
they are convinced that two
7-year-old girls, missing sincei
5 pm. yesterday from their
homes in the Brookville area,
were lured into a car by a
man and taken away.
This theory, which grew In
intensity as the hours length

WASHINGTON, D. C.—Six brokerage houses in New York
City, two in Delaware and one each in Massachusetts and Mis

Power Company as all the thousands of company stockholders
in the State of Montana. (Leading the list, with 300,000 shares
with a current stock market value of more than $9,000,000, is
Carothers & Clark of Wilmington, Del.—PV Editor.)

Battin Committee
Accused of Lying
By Fred Barrett
CHESTER — ""Republicans
cer
tainly have little regard for the
truth, especially when they are try
ing to extract campaign dollars
from businessmen,"" Fred Barrett,
chairman of the Democratic State
Central Committee, said Wednes
day.
""The letter the Battin Club sent
out to businessmen charging Leo
Graybill Jr.
000 from COPE and the Farmers
Union is the biggest lie they have
told so far in this campaign,"" Bar
rett said. ""The combined expendi
tures of Graybill, Arnold Olsen,
Robert Durkee and the state cen
tral committee will net reach
receiving $100,
was
$100,000 in this election.
Anyone that would give their
approval to such a lie a» this
would certainly not be too con
cerned about lying to the voters,
Barrett asserted.

From Bozeman, from Livingston, from Lewistown, the re

0ne hard-bitten liberal leader,

formed in his eye as he told the py :
"" those P 00r devils, I actually felt

Continuing, he said that the Liv
ingston taxorama speakers turned
red and literally wilted under pene
trating questions put to them by
Park County Rep. Warren Harper
and former Sweetgrass Rep, Claude
Gray, among others.
Gray, he said, hit them in a very
sore spot when he wanted to know
why, in their quest for a better
business climate, they didn't take
issue with Montana Power Co. and
the outrageous gas and electric
rate, that utility gets away with

of Knowles Dam on the Flathead
River. Knowles would produce more
than six times as much power as
Montana Power Company's proposed
alternatives, and power from Knowles
would be marketed at Bonneville
Power Administration rates, which
are substantially less than those
charged by MPCo,

Power Commission by power com
panies show that last year revenue
per kilowatt hour sold for resi
dential or domestic use by the Mon

It is almost three times the .92
cents received by the municipal
system in Eugene, Oregon, almost
four times the .81 cents received
by the City of McMinnville, an
other Oregon municipal. It is al
most half again as much as was
received by the Idaho Power Com
pany (1.63 cents) and California
Pacific Utilities Company (1.69
cents).
Some companies are more respon
sive to the needs of local ratepayers
than distant stockholders. Thus, more
fortunate consumers outside Mon
tana can use much more electricity
and still pay less than Empeeco rate-1
payers,

Bulletin Issued On
Managing Family Forest
WASHINGTON, D. C.—The U. S.
Department of Agriculture has issued
a bulletin on family forest manage
ment, designed to aid 4,5 million
American families who own more
than half of the country's commercial
ly valuable timberland—timberland
that is expected to supply half of the
nation's forest products by the year
2000 .
The booklet, ""Managing the Fam
ily Forest"", tells owners of small
| woodlands how to bring their forests
up to the productive requirements of
future timber markets. It reviews
forest management techniques that
government and industry have de
veloped to make forest land more
productive and profitable. It describes
the technical forestry assistance now
available.

which last week received more than
$1 million from the Bureau of Land
Management as the state's share of
resource development earnings.
Montana received $1,127,360.77.
Mineral leases and permits
duced $1,084,842.73, with the bal

grazing, land and timber sales.
The mineral payments represent
37 % % of total receipts for the
six-month period ended June 30.

The grazing and timber sale money
covers the entire 1962 fiscal year.
Payment to the 27 states which

Coffee Exporters
Adopt Guide Lines
NEW YORK CITY—(CNS)—A
United Nations coffee conference
adopted international guide lines for
the industry at a 1-day meeting here
September 28. x
The agreement is designed to in
crease the purchasing power of cof
fee-producing nations by maintaining
stable prices and raising coffee con
sumption. Since the economy of many
Latin American nations is tied to this
one crop, over-production has had
both political and economic reper
cussions.
Delegates from 71
reached preliminary agreement here
August 25 and set up an international
countries
coffee councjl in London. Each will
be represented. The conference fixed
coffee quotas for 36 exporting coun
tries for the next five years. Brazil
received the highest quota—about
two-fifths of world output.
Candidates Endorsed . .
Justice Court Amendment
Opposed By Rail Clerks
Contending that the proposed amendment to take Justice
Courts out from under the State Constitution opens the way
for legislative elimination of the ""poor man's courts"", the state
legislative committee of Railway Clerks, Sunday, went on rec
ord in opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment.
The Clerks, chaired by E. F. English, held their biennial legis
lative meeting in Havre.
On the second constitutional
amendment to be before the voters
November 6, providing for extending
the terms of county attorneys from
two to four years, the Clerks also
voiced opposition. Reasoning on this
is that electing county attorneys
every two years gives the voters less
delay in expressing their dissatisfac
tion in case such officials don't
measure up.
]?ive candidates for state and fed
eral offices were given the Clerks'
endorsement. These candidates are:
Congress, first district: Rep. Arnold
Olsen;
Congress, second district; Leo
Graybill, Jr.;
State Auditor; Sen. Robert Dur
kee;
Associate Justice No, 1; Judge
Hugh Adair, and
Associate Justice No. 2; Gordon
Bennett,
No candidate for Railroad and
Public Service Commissioner received
Clerks' approval. Concensus was that
neither Comm. Jack Holmes or his
Republican opponent. Art Watson,
were worthy of the support of or
ganized labor.
RETIREMENT RULES TALKED

Co-op leader
Doesn't 'Savvy'
Montana GOP
Qï
HELENA—(CNS)—Montana Re
publicans decided to make co-opera
tive taxation an issue this year. The
state platform adopted here last
summer, reads:
We believe in fair and equal treat
ment of all forms of business enter
prise. We support and defend the
right of co-operatives to do business
in Montana. However, we believe
that co-operatives have now grown
in sufficient stature that they should
no longer be granted special income
tax advantages, but should now as
sume their fair share of the cost of
government.
Jerry Voorhis, the Co-operative
League's executive director, point
ed out in Chicago that co-ops have
no special income tax advantage
and are paying their fair share of
the cost of government. In many
..
areas co-ops pay the highest prop
erty tax, he said.
Voorhis said he failed to see how
any political party in a farm state
could in good conscience support such
twisted"" concept of co-op taxes.
He pointed out that both 1960 presi
dential candidates supported co-ops.
Both national platforms have sup
ported co-ops for many years, Voor
his said. The last five Republican
Presidents are on record in their
support of co-ops, he added.

EDITOR'S THOUGHT; Former 6
term Calif. Cong. Voorhis may be
out of touch with Montana's brand
of ""modem Republicanism"". In their
eyes, the late Robert A. Taft, because
he supported federal aid to educa
tion, was ""suspect"", and of course,
everybody knows that the GOP's rul
ing faction in Montana concur with
the Birchites in looking upon ex
Pres. Eishenhower as a radical be
cause of his continuing staunch sup
port for the United Nations and for
eign aid. Some of them even look
at their most honored of
elder statesmen, Herbert Hoover, be
cause he approved a very limited
amount of public power development.
Teddy Roosevelt, being a distant cou
sin of Franklin, is rarely mentioned
in most Montana Republican circles.
•>
ployment compensation act since it
was enacted in 1937. He pointed out
that the original act along with nu
merous amendments since, is a com
plicated legal document.
Three presidentially-appointed men
make up the board. One is from rail
road management, one from rail
labor ,\ and the third is a public mem
ber. In Montana there are two field
offices. The Great Falls one and the
other in Billings.
The of
erage, provides for 1. retirement at
age 65 or over and minimum of ten
years service for full earned bene
fits. Retirement, at a reduced month
ly pension may be taken at age 62;
2, disability retirement at age 60
with partial benefits when disability
bars further rail work but is not
sufficient to incapacitate for some
other line of work; 3. total and perm
anent disability; 4. age and service
retirement for women at age 60, and
30 years service, with no reduction

Cuba and the U. N.
The state of the world being what
It Is, and the United Nations having long
since become a sounding board for the
most outrageous kind of propaganda,
there is nothing particularly astonish
ing about the windy, low-level harangue
just addressed to the General Assembly
by President Dortlcos of Communist
Cuba. Beyond that, one may say that
the grossness of his performance, its
coarseness, constitutes yet another re
vealing but not surprising measure of
the noisome character of Fidel Castro's
Kremlin-serving tyranny in Havana.
Accordingly, our U. N. Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson has not exaggerated in
assailing it as a contemptible melange
of “unparalleled calumnies, slanders
and misrepresentations.” It is a speech
which leaves little room for doubt that
Cuba’s ""chief of state” has staged his
ugly little act before the General As
sembly with the complete blessing and
behind - the - scenes direction of our
friends In the Kremlin.
All of which makes a kind of farce
of what Mr. Dorticos has said. And this
applies especially to his demand that
the General Assembly formally “con
demn” our country for its “aggressive
acts” against Cuba. Needless to say, If
even a sizeable number of members
should vote in favor of such action, the
U. N.—whose very existence depends In
large measure upon the help our coun
try Is giving It—would almost certainly
die a quite sudden death. And deservedly.
Try, Try Again
* The House and the Senate now have
resolved the first phase of the Franklin
Delano Roosevelt Memorial controversy
with celerity and sound judgment. We
hope, as a result, that nothing more will
be heard of the strange agglomeration of
towering concrete slabs which the Roose
velt Memorial Commission had proposed
to erect in West Potomac Park —an
architectural creation which would have
been appropriate neither to that area
nor, as Representative James Roosevelt
stated In the House debate, to the mem
ory of the former President.
In rejecting this design, however,
the new act wisely affords the Me
morial Commission wide latitude in its
search for a more fitting memorial, and
authorizes the funds necessary to ac
complish the job. It Is well, also, that
the act requires the commission to ob
tain the concurrence of the Fine Arts
Commission before submitting an al
ternative proposal, a condition which
should minimize the likelihood of furth
er public controversy once an agreement
Is reached.
Decision in Poolesville
The controversy over whether to
retain the rural small-town flavor of
Poolesville, Md., or to seek a solution to
Its very real problems through the popu
lar expedient of annexation was the
business of the residents of that tiny
Montgomery County community. Their
decision to reject the annexation pro
posal, by the conclusive margin of 101
votes to 74, was a courageous one. The
town can take a high degree of pride,
moreover, In the fact that only 11 reg
istered voters failed to appear at the
polls on referendum day.
While it was theirs to make, however,
the decision should be widely applauded
in Montgomery County as a whole. For
the suburban development planned by
private Investors in the five square miles
proposed for annexation conflicts with
both the Year 2000 Plan for the region
and the general outlines of the master
plan for Montgomery County which has
been proposed by the staff of the Mary
land-National Capital Park and Plan
ning Commission. Admittedly the coun
ty-wide plan has not yet been adopted,
or even refined in specific’ detail. Still,
It would have been unfortunate if,
through annexation, this large and
strategic area had been removed from
all county land-use control during this
critical period of the plan’s development.
Indeed, the Poolesville case illus
trates a manner by which effective
county planning can be (and, unfor
tunately, In some Instances Is being)
subverted through constant annexation.
What good Is a county plan, no matter
how widely accepted by the region as a
whole, If strategic portions of the county
can be fragmented through annexation
by towns and cities which are capable
under existing law of exercising develop
ment controls without regard for their
Impact on the'larger area? In view of
mounting concern about this question,
the Planning Commission staff has sug
gested State legislation which would
specify that the county retain zoning,
planning and subdivision controls over
all areas which may be annexed in the
future. Such legislation of course would
be difficult to obtain. The problem is
an important one, which should be fully
explored at the public hearings which
will be held on the new county plan
during the next several months.
Historic Church Council
Thoughtful persons of every reli
gious faith will follow with interest one
of the most impressive church conclaves
of all time, the Ecumenical Council
called by Pope John XXIII in Rome. As
outlined by this far-sighted head of the
Roman Catholic Church, the council’s
debates and decisions will have mean
ing beyond the scope of the church
itself.
Ninety years have gone by since the
last Vatican Council, years in which
communism has nibbled away at the
foundation of religion in many areas.
None has battled more assiduously
against this evil than the Vatican. And
three months after his coronation, Pope
bJohn called another council to “provide
the light of great example.”
Despite Soviet atheism, or perhaps
because of it, religion still has moved
forward in the Free World. Os utmost
importance to all faiths is the highest
ideal underlining the council call—the
Pontiff’s hope for unity of 538 million
Roman Catholics with 138 million of
the Eastern Orthodox Churches and 215
million Protestants.
Looking to this goal, Pope John set
up a Secretariat for Promoting Christian
Unity more than two years ago. Only
the most sanguine believe such unity
could emerge directly from the Ecumen
ical. But the encouraging point is that
a start is being made, and as Augustin
Cardinal Bea, the inexhaustible 81-year
old German Jesuit, said, the council
could “prepare for an eventual union,
God willing, by bettering relations be
tween Catholic and non-Catholic Chris
tians.”
It is obvious that basic beliefs, the
beliefs affirmed by Martin Luther and
others, still are poles apart from Cath
olic doctrine. But even as some Prot
estant churches have been uniting in
this country, Pope John hopes for a start
toward total unity by bringing the Ro
man Catholic church closer to the East
ern Orthodox. Many Protestant church
men believe eventual unity is possible
only through the World Council of
Churches.
Perhaps most significant is the fact
that, whereas 90 years ago there were
no Protestant observers at the Ecumen
ical, 100 official and unofficial observers
will attend this session. Another inter
esting development is the co-operation
among Catholics and Jews, the latter
“exploring ways Jews might observe or
contribute to the success” of the council.
The council is expected to issue a clear
statement denouncing anti-semitism.
Joining the nearly 3,000 Catholic
churchmen from all parts of the world
will be five cardinals, 30 archbishops
and 185 bishops from America. Os that
number, delegates from Washington and
Catholic University will play an im
portant part. All of them carry our best,
wishes for success.
Shorter Soviet Rations
Once again Soviet leaders are
obliged to confess to their own people
—and for them, this is not easy—that
visions of eating high off the hog are
premature. For the fourth straight
year, something has gone wrong with
the virgin land wheat crop, Premier
Khrushchev’s own baby, and a main
stay in his boast that one day Russian
tables would be as loaded as ours.
There isn’t much new in the central
theme of a familiar script. As usual
the farmers cut their grain in windrows
to dry, expecting combines to come
along, gather and thresh- it. Even if
this is not the American way, it might
have produced some results but for one
oversight. The combines, thousands of
them rusting in the fields, did not show
up. Reason? Chiefly no spare parts. So
much of the grain rotted in the rows.
It is an old, sad story. With all
their know-how, their successes in space,
their armaments build-up, their stress
on industrial development, the Russians
have never acquired the capacity for
making the farm program work. While
pushing for more farm machinery, they
have neglected to supply spare parts
for that already available.
Os course this is only the most
immediate cause of failure. Basically,
the program is tortured by collectivi
zation and state farm methods, which
the peasants still resist. American ob
servers have found that on one 18,000-
acre farm, supporting 4,000 persons,
there were 1,050 “workers.” But only
100 were working, tha others “fiddling
around.”
Even Mr. Khrushchev has admitted
that Russian farming methods are in
ferior to ours, and he has had his
minister of agriculture take a month’s
tour of the United States to soak up
some of our reasons for over-abundance.
Even if Mr. K. G. Pysin has absorbed
a great deal, there is no reason to be
lieve this knowledge can be readily
applied to collectivized or state farms,
where individual incentive is wanting.
The farming effort by nearly half the
Russian population has been unable to
approach the agricultural production
of 8.6 per cent of our people.
Despite cajolery and hectoring by
Mr. Khrushchev and others, Russian
productivity is no more than holding
even, and with the latest disaster, may
be slipping back. And because of a
breakdown in plowing, the portents for
next year’s crop are just as grim. Small
wonder the Soviet bosses sometimes
despair to the point of trying to copy
the decadent capitalists.

The Cost of Political Living Reaches an All-Time High
LETTERS TO THE STAR
Low and Disorder
Reading the letters which
appeared in the Oct. 3. edi
tion of The Star, it seemed
to me that the writers on the
subject of the recent events
in OJe Miss did not put the
situation in its proper per
spective Much emphasis
was put on the theory that
the university wm forced by
the Federal Government to
admit Meredith and conse
quently there arose the riots
and violence. Furthermore
there were some hints that
President Kennedy did the
forcing. Nothing of the kind
happened.
The Federal Courts, both
in Washington and New Or
leans ordered the admission
of Meredith to the university,
which order the Governor
treated as a scrap of paper;
and he snubbed the court in
New Orleans (incidentally
made up in its entirety of
Southerners, who made their
decision in accordance with
the law of the land, and were
not influenced by their per
sonal feelings or emotions).
These are the same men
whose motives along with
those of our President were
impugned and their integrity
questioned by Senator Byrd
of Virginia, who charged col
lusion between the court and
the President to force the ad
mission of Meredith. This is
a gratuitous insult to the
court and to the President,
who performed his duty and
responsibility as the Chief
Executive, imposed upon him
by his oath of office and the
Constitution of this country,
to see to it that the law of
the land is to be obeyed. The
Governor on the other hand
thought that he could be a
law unto himself, disregard
ing entirely the basic princi
ple Os freedom and democra
cy, that the law is no re
specter of person or rank
equal justice under the law.
This act of placing himself
above the law could lead
only to chaos and violence,
as was proved by the events
on the Mississippi campus.
Abe Shefferman
♦» » »
Because James Meredith
sought to enter the Univer
sity of Mississippi, a State in
stitution, and such entry was
denied him by the State of
Mississippi, even to the extent
of direct action by the Gov
ernor. everyone must admit
that the controversy, regard
less of the, merits of either
side. Involved a State. Section
3, Article 111 of the Consti
tution of the United States
states ""The judicial power
shall extend to all cases, in
law and equity, arising under
this Constitution . . .” and
“In all cases ... in which a
State shall be party, the
Supreme Court shall have
original jurisdiction.”
The case was not tried
before the Supreme Court.
No other court of the United
States could, under the Con
stitution, have jurisdiction,
nor has the President such
jurisdiction. The method pre
scribed in the Constitution is
clear, but was not followed.
Messrs. John and Robert
Kennedy have extended their
powers far beyond Consti
tutional limits.
Also, Section 8, Article I of
the Constitution gives Con
gress power ""To provide for
calling forth the militia .to
execute the laws of the Union,
suppress insurrections . . .”
Certainly, Congress has
passed no law covering the
situation at hand (Meredith
vs. Mississippi) and. if it had,
there would be a serious ques
tion as to its Constitution
ality, in view or what are
supposed to be States’ rights
under the Tenth Amendment.
In addition, interpretations
and verdicts of Federal courts
Inferior to the Supreme Court
in this matter are of no
status since the controversy
Involves a State (see above).
Further, opposition by the
State of Mississippi to these
unconstitutional Federal
court decisions and orders
does not constitute insur
rection Perhaps the activities
*of Gen. Walker may yet be
interpreted"" as insurrection,
but that will have to be
decided by a due process of
law. if the matter is pursued.
It, therefore, appears that
with respect to Meredith vs.
Pen names may be used if
letters carry writers’ correct
names and addresses. All let
ters are subject to condensa
tion. Those not used will be
returned only when accom
panied by self • addressed,
stamped envelopes.
Mississippi, the use of the
militia by the Federal Gov
ernment was seriously im
proper. However, lest there be
any doubt, the answer is
clearly given by the Second
Amendment to the Consti
tution “A well regulated
militia, being necessary to the
security of a free State, the
right of the people to keep
and bear arms, shall not be
infringed.” When President
Kennedy federalized the Mis
sissippi National Guard (mili
tia) for the purpose he did
and not for the protection of
the United States during a
war, he patently violated the
Constitution. How could Gov.
Barnett have contended with
a serious uprising of violence
within his State, or a prison
break or a disaster which
might occur while Missis
sippi’s National Guard was
under Federal control? Presi
dent Eisenhower was also
guilty of the same breach of
the Constitution when he
similarly acted at Little Rock,.
Arkansas.
Had the case been tried
before the Supreme Court
and a verdict rendered in
favor of Meredith, and had
the State of Mississippi then
refused to abide by the de
cision, I would agree that the
President should use force as
he has done, in enforcing the
law. But this is not the way
it happened. Consequently,
the President has violated the
Constitution in at least two
respects using force in
lieu of the lawful consider
ation of the case by the
Supreme Court and feder
alizing the State militia with
out authority that is valid.

Darwin and Marx
Col. C. I. Kephart in a
letter, takes Dale Crowley, .
jr., to task for criticizing
Eric Sevareids support of
Darwin’s theory of evolution.
The colonel speaks out
with assurance on his theory
of origins by “casual muta
tions.” In ""The Genesis
Flood.” John C. Whitcomb,
Th.D., and Henry M. Morris,
Ph.D. (Professor and Head
of Department of Civil En
gineering, V.PX) quote Rich
ard Goldschmidt:
""It is true that nobody
thus far has produced a new
species of genus, etc., by
macromutation. It is equally
true that nobody has pro
duced even a species by the
selection of micro mu ta
tions. . Recently I spoke
to a gentleman in our area
who publishes and sells books
on natural history, and asked
him if scientists (philoso
phers) had considered ""de
sign"" in the origins in na
ture. He said. “That’s an
other matter.” I asked him
if they had ever been able
to produce a new species by
cross-breeding (for instance,
getting the mule to creed).
He said they had not, “but
almost.” Neither mutations
nor cross-breeding ever pro
duce a new species! Give us
millions of years and we can,
they cry. They can’t.
A ""theory” is an unproven
idea. Darwin's came to light
100 years ago. Thousands of
years before the Hebrew
writer recorded that “God""
created (plants and animals)
after his kind,” and there it
Blays! Period! It further says,
“God created man in His
own image. . . male and fe
male created He them.”
(Genesis 1:27). They did not
evolve. They were created by
God and were never apes.
R. N. Car»w Hunt in his
“The Theory And Practice Os
Comm unism” (Macmillan),
speaking of Marx's ""Capital
ism.” says: “He wished to
dedicate it to Darwin,, but
the latter declined the-honor
in a cautious letter"". . . Marx,
with all Communists, ac
cepted Darwin's g theistic phi
losophy as the physiological
basis for their economic-po
litical-murderous movement.

JFK's Politicking
We have just been advised
via a radio news bulletin
that, because of a head cold,
the President has, cancelled
all appointments to rest up
for a strenuous week-end of
campaigning for Democratic
candidates.
Since when has it become
more important for the Pres
ident of the United States to
go out and campaign for
local candidates than it is
for him to keep appoint-,
ments relating to the busi
ness of the whole country?
He might better spend his
time trying to redeem him
self for having sent armed
troops against citizens of the
United States when he
wouldn’t give loyal Cubans
their promised air cover in
their attempt to overthfttw
Communist Castro.
He seems much more in
terested in being sure he
placates the NAACP and
seeing that Democratic can
didates (not the least of
which is Brother Teddy) are
elected, than he is in trying to
protect us from communism.
In fact, while he immedi
ately and courageously called
out troops against the people
of Mississippi, he hesitates
to do anything which might
offend the Communist lead-
* ers of Russia, Cuba, Yugo
slavia, etc., and the so-called
neutrals, India, Krishna
Menon, etc.
Catherine Wells Barber.

The recent attacks and
counter-attacks by Broyhill
vs. Salinger and Kennedys
are unfortunate, because
they cloud the important is
sues to be decided in the
election in the 10th District
of Virginia.
It is easy to understand
how temper can be displayed
by Congressman Broyhill, if
you have been the recipient
of Kennedy’s underhanded
political tactics, of which
even members of his own
party have been victims.
""Love me and love anything
or anyone I approve or else
...” is the President’s motto.
He leaves no room for any
one else’s opinion.
I regret that the President
is not able to rise above
petty “politicking,” and fill
the place of President of the
United States, with the dig
nity and integrity that the
office stands for. I want to
be proud of our President
even if his views differ from
mine.
.Americans respect op
posite- opinions if they are
stated with sincerity and
true statesmanship. When
low standards are set by the
party which holds office, it
is extremely difficult not to
fight fire with fire.

Sensible Slogan
Fire Prevention Week runs
from October 7 to 13.
Many years ago California
offered a prize for a slogan
which best told the story of
a large burned-over tract of
timber in that State. A pan
oramic picture was shown
with a large stand of virgin
timber—the trees were mag
nificent and lordly with their
bountiful leaves or foilage and
the symmetry of their out
lines. In the background
could be seen some wild
animals of the forest enjoy
ing the peaceful scene. There
were many deer, squirrels,
pheasants, a few small bear
• cubs, and others gaily cavort
in the freedom of the area—
all was peace and calm and
the duff on the ground was
quiU deep, representing the
accumulation of years, pro
viding shelter or warmth for
the creatures.
The prize of SIOOO for an
appropriate slogan in line
with the ever-present hazard
of forest fires in that State
was won by a forestry student
at the University of Califor
nia. Here is the prize slogan:
""This is God’s country: don’t
start a fire and make it look
like hell!”
I submit this to you and
your readers in the hope that
slogan will register with them
and inspire people to think
extra seriously about start
ing fires or being careless
about God’s country!

Kennedy-Khrushchev Talk Likely
PARIS
The one thing on which
nearly everybody now seems
agreed is that an early meet
ing between President Ken
nedy and Premier Khru
shchev is highly probable.
-If Mr. Kennedy is not in
terested in coming to Mos
cow, Mr. Khrushchev, it is
felt, will come to New York
for the General Assembly
session of the United Na
tions. And if he comes, Mr.
Kennedy has already indi
cated that he would ask him
to stop by, providing, of
course, that nothing unpleas
ant has happened in Berlin
in the meantime.
Apart from the impression
that Mr. Khrushchev is anx
ious for such a meeting,
however, conflicting ideas
about its usefulness, its dan
gers and its probable results
are as thick as the autumn
leaves. As is usually the case
where the motives of the
Russian Premier are in
volved, Western opinion is
divided between those who
hope there is nothing to be
lost and those who fear there
is nothing to be gained.
The argument, at least,
has advanced a stage from
the rather sterile bickering
between the ""hard line”
Allies who oppose any dis
cussion of the Berlin prob
lem and the ""flexible” school
which feels that negotiation
is at all times preferable to
war. A curious fact is that
some of the most rigid of
hardliners are the most opti
mistic about the possibilities
of a Khrushchev - Kennedy
meeting at this stage.
Pessimists vs. Optimists
The pessimists today are
those who believe that Mr.
Khrushchev has been mis
led by American efforts to
keep open the lines of East-
West communication on Ber
lin. If Premier Khrushchev
should come to Washington
under the false impression
that he can wring important
concessions from the Presi
dent, the results of the meet
ing might, indeed, be even
worse than those of their
first encounter in Vienna last
year.
A number of arguments are
heard in these parts, how
ever, that this may not be the
case. The moi‘e optimistic
line of speculation holds that
Mr. Khrushchev is once again
anxious to forestall a crisis
on Berlin rather than precip
itate one.
The timetable ascribed to
the Russian Premier by the
prophets in Washington is
questioned by some experts
here. According to this time-
A BOOK FOR TODAY

Theories About Our Ancient Redmen
LOST TRIBES & SUNKEN
CONTINENTS, Myth and
Method in the Study of
the American Indians. By
Robert Wauchope.,lss pp.,
illus. (University of Chi
cago Press: $3.95.)
Workers in most areas of
science and scholarship 'can
go their way unimpeded by
fervent and misguided lay
men who plant themselves in
the middle of the path and
|ell the professionals that
they are nothing but vicious,
igrtorant fools while simulta
neously appealing for profes
sional sanction of favorite,
personal theories. But an in
cautious astronomer may find
himself listening to an ex
position of a strange theory
of the origin of the solar
system, and imprudent an
thropologists and archeolo
gists are forever being told
about lost tribes and sunken
continents.
Robert Wauchope, director
of the Middle American Re
search Institute and professor
of anthropology at Tulane
University, is deliberately im
prudent because ""one won
ders what theories are these
that so capture imagination
and fierce allegiance, and
what sort of men are so ob
sessed with mystic and re
ligious interpretation of the
ancient American past that
they will follow them, some
times literally, to the death
against all opposition.”
“Lost Tribes St Sunken
Continents” results not from
""one’s” wonder but from Prof.
Wauchope’s. The little book
undertakes to examine the
nature of these various un
acceptable ""interpretations of
the ancient American past""
and to tell the reader some
thing of the men who have
contrived and defended them.
BOTH THEORIES and men
are numerous. “Perhaps the
most popular theory about
American Indian origins de
rives the famous ancient
civilizations of Mexico, Cen
tral America, and the Andes
from Egypt.” Then there are
those, and they are “the
truly enthusiastic non-profes
sionals,” who look elsewhere
for these mysterious origins:
Primarily to ""Lost Atlantis""
or “The Lost Tribes of Israel."" •
Then there is the Kublai
Khan theory which holds that
the culture of the American ,
Indians was derived from
China in the 13th century
A. D. And there is a variant
of this, the ""Men Out of
Asia” idea, that holds “that
after the death of Alexander
the Great in 323 B C., some
survivors of his wrecked fleet
under Admiral Nearchus
sailed* eastward, picking up
artisans in India and South
eastern Asia, and made an
epic voyage across the Pacific,
where they and their descen
dants were responsible for the
table, Mr. Khrushchev will
move quickly after the Amer
ican congressional elections
on November 6 to sign his
long-threatened separate
peace treaty with East Ger
many and then will come to
New York to defend his ac
tion in the General Assembly.
A meeting with the Presi
dent under these circum
stances would hardly seem
auspicious.
Some European experts be
lieve that the order of things
will be reversed. Mr. Khru
shchev in the past four years,
has made full use of the
peace treaty threat as a dip
lomatic lever. It is believed
he will not sign away this
useful leverage without at
least one more attempt to
reopen a top-level discus
sion of the whole Berlin prob
lem.
Treaty Signing Later
It is believed therefore,
that any trip to New York
would take place before the
signing of a separate peace
treaty with East Germany.
Its purpose would not be to
justify an action but to rally
support for attendance at a
peace conference among the
neutralist nations. The Rus
sians, it is felt here, have al
ways looked forward to mak
ing the peace conference as
impressive an affair as pos
sible—and one which might
last for weeks or even
months.
Similarly, any meeting with
President Kennedy would be
more a search for alterna
tives than ap effort to con
front the President with a
fait accompli. The impression
remains that Mr. Khru
shchev is not really anxious
to carry out,his threat and
would cheerfully seize on any
reasonable pretext for post
poning the action once again.
Such a pretext might be
found, perhaps, in a Western
proposal for an international
authority to control access
to Berlin, talk of which has
been revived in recent days.
Prolonged negotiation on
such a crucial question could
provide justification for a
new delay with Mr. Khru
shchev's own militant critics
at home.
It is perfectly possible, of
course, that this relatively
optimistic speculation is
wrong and that Mr. Khru
shchev’s timetable allows for
no such flexibility. On the
present evidence, however, it
is hard to agree with those
who argue that any meeting
would do more harm than
good and that the door of
the White House should at
all cost remain firmly barred.
pre-Columbian nign civiliza
tions of the Maya region and
the Peruvian Andes.”
But this Is not all. There
is the “Kon-Tiki” Idea which
is more or less the reverse.
It holds that ""Polynesian
populations and culture were
. . . derived from South
America, carried about A. D.
500 by the legendary Peru
vian culture-hero, the blond
god Viracocha and his fellow
migrants.""
The holders of these views
are often guilty of an at
titude that puzzles the sci
entist. He cannot reconcile
""their proud avowal on the
one hand that they are not
bound by the scientists’ rules
of empirical research and
are quite willing to use in*
tuition or supernaturally de
rived evidence in their ‘re
search’” with their contin
ued protests ""that they are
as scientific as anyone else
in their methods.”
PROF, WAUCHOPE cannot
hope to refute this rich col
lection of assorted theories.
For his book is brief and it
is in the nature of science
that its rebuttal of pseudo
science is as complex as the
pseudo-science itself is sim
ple. But Carlton Cooley’s dis
cussion of some of these
matters in an elementary
textbook shows that it is pos
sible to do far more than
has Prof. Wauchope.
Then, too, we are told al
most nothing about the psy
chological motivation of the
holders of ""wild theories” ‘
and literally nothing about
the sociology of organized
groups of believers.
Prof. Wauchope never calls
these people a name as bad
as ""crackpots.” Frequently,
he calls them ""mystics.” In
the last chapter, he men
tions Martin Gardner's term,
""crank pseudo-scientists,”
and Indirectly suggests that
those he has been discussing
are fully qualified for that
name. Os course, he is a sci
entist and he stands with the
empirical method. This coy
ness about labels strikes the
reader as resulting more
from a misplaced desire not
to offend—for offense
enough is given anyway—
than from due scientific cau
tion.

Q. What started the custom
of presenting an honored
visitor with the keys of a
city? G. G.
A. This goes back to me
dieval times, when every
fortified town in Europe was
surrounded by walls and
people could enter or leave
only by the gates. The keys
were kept by the mayor or
the military commander, and
the surrendering of the keys

Metro Area
[Crisis Adds Emphasis
To Virginia Ballot
By ALEX R. PRESTON
Star Staff Writer
This Nation’s quarantine of
Cuba places renewed emphasis
on an amendment to the Vir
ginia Constitution which voters
will be asked to approve No
vember 6.
The amendment, the second
and only non-controversial one
Os three referendum questions
•n the ballot, provides for the
Emergency enactment of laws
in the event of a nuclear at
tack on Virginia soil which,
presumably, would result in
high casualties among lawmak-
The proposal, which had met
bo opposition, is given new sig
nificance by President Kenne
dy's declaration to the Nation
Monday night that missile
bases capable of reaching al-
Wst all this Nation have been
built and are being installed in
Chiba.
-'The Lgeislature had antici
pated the need for possible
emergency action three years
lgo v Unless by Constitutional
tonvention, the only other
method of amending the State’s
organic law is passage by two
successive sessions of the Gen
fcrtQ.Assembly of identical reso
lutions proposing the change
Which then is submitted to the
voters.
Up to Voters
' The General Assembly in
i 960 proposed the emergency
measure and the session this
year reaffirmed the action. Vot
er approval automatically will
put it into effect.
There are 100 members of the
house of Delegates and 40
members of the State Senate.
This would be the effect of the
addition of proposed new lan
kaige, to be known as Section
50-a:
' .""In case of enemy attack
upon the soil of Virginia by
nuclear fission of fission bombs
or devices . . ~” the Governor
may declare by an emergency
that'a quorum of the General
Assembly cannot be called. A
quorum now consists of a sim
ple majority of both houses;
that is, 21 Senators and 51
Delegates.
An emergency quorum would
consist of “not less than two
fifths of the members elected
to each house.” This means
that laws passed under the
Governor’s proclamation could
be passed by only 16 Senators
and 40 Delegates.
There is a further complica
tion, however: Any such laws
would require the affirmative
“vote of four-fifths of the
members of each house present
and voting.” This means that a
bill would have to be approved
by at least 12 of the 16 Sena
tors and 32 of the 40 Dele
gates.
Duration of Laws
The proposed new Section
50-a also provides that any law
passed under the nuclear attack
emergency could remain in ef
fect no longer than one year
and could not again be adopted
except through the regular
procedure set out in the Con
stitution.
The same session of the Gen
eral Assembly which anticipat
ed today’s emergency three
years ago also passed another
law providing for a line of suc
cession to the Governor’s office.
This already is law and does
not require approval of the vot
ers.
Prior to 1960 the Governor’s
office, if vacated, would have
been filled, in order, by the
Lieutenant Governor, the Presi
dent Pro-tem of the Senate, the
Speaker of the House and then
the Secretary of the Common
wealth.
Order of Succession
The order of succession has
been changed so that it now
is:
Governor, Lieutenant-Gover
nor, the Attorney General “if
elected,” or, if appointed, then
the Speaker of the House, the
President Pro-tem of the Sen
ate (which places the Speaker
ahead of the President Pro
tem) and, if the Senate is not
in session, the President‘Pro
tem at the last preceeding ses
sion.

'fwo Families Flee
Burning Home
A fire that started near a
basement oil furnace forced
two Takoma Park (Md.) fam
ilies, including three children,
from their home yesterday, fire
officials reported.
The fire, at 7004 Westmore
land avenue, caused an esti
mated $7,000 damage, accord
ing to Deputy Chief Baron De-
Kalb of the Takoma Park Fire
Department.
Mr. and Mrs. P. E. Ball and
Mr. and Mrs. M. L. Johnson,
who live in the two-family
house, were at home at the
time along with the three Ball
children, Mr. DeKalb said.
One of the Ball children dis

his mother, the deputy chief
said. Both families quickly left
the building.
Five Holdups Probed,
All Near Police Station
Mount Rainier (Md.) police
men are working overtime in an
effort to capture bandits who
have stolen more than $3,554
recently in five holdups within
two blocks of the police station.
Chief Thomas E. Alsop said
all 10 of his officers, five of
whom are part-time employes,
have been maintaining close
surveillance of the two-block
strip on Rhode Island avenue,
where the holdups have oc
curred.
Descriptions given by wit
nesses at each of the five busi
ness establishments coincide in
several respects. Chief Alsop
said. They all characterize the
holdup man as a slender, light
skinned Negro in his early 20’s,
between 5-foot 5 inches and
5-foot 8 inches tall.
Witnesses saw the bandit
escape in a car driven by
-another man after two of the
i holdups. On one occasion, the
- escape car was a blue Ford and
! another time it was a yellow
l colored cab with District of
. Columbia license tags.

which have taken place be
, tween the District line at East

Rainier bus terminal, began ors
September 6 when a man
walked into Maryland Wine

On Ballot
Explained
Montgomery County vot
ers will decide or have a hand
in deciding 11 questions of
importance to the county and
the state when they mark
ballots in the general election
Wednesday.
Up for decision are two pro
posed amendments to the coun
ty charter, five constitutional
amendments and four referen
dum questions. One of the
amendments to the county char
ter concerns the local option in
the Darnestown district.
All other questions on the bal
lot may be marked by any quali
fied voter in the county.
The first question on the bal- 1 '
lot would provide for appoint- j
ment of new County Council
members should a vacancy de- 1
velop. As the present charter I
is written, there is no machinery 1
for such appointments.
The second question concerns
the local option amendment and
may be voted on by Sixth Dis
trict voters only.
Five proposed amendments to
the state constitution are on the
OPEN LETTER
from
BARNEY WELSH ]
Dear County Litigant:
This past Terrible Tuesday things
were so tense it occurred to me j
that there would be no election on j
Tuesday, November the 6th, and
that the least a bomb would do
would be to get rid of all the ‘
election posters along the high- I
ways. And although I am con- (
vinced that Walter Moorman will (
make a splendid judge for our Cir
cuit Court, still I was not pre
pared to run from a bomb shelter
into an election booth to vote for
him even for your sake. But short
of that trip I am going to vote for
Walter Moorman.
His number is 33-D, end I have
no need for a geiger counter to
find the lever beside his name.
Walter Moorman does not need a
number. He has acquired a fine
name in this county—particularly
among his fellow lawyers. He has
become distinguished as a hard 1
fighter for the rights of his client t
and an honest adversary. A man ]
with such a raputation for good \
lawyering over many years should j
make a superb judge. That is why
I am going to vote for him, and *
were I a prospective litigant I ' 1
would vote for him too.

FREEDOM
I do not suppose many people will reed my opinion on Freedom,
but I will voice it under the besis opportunity of freedom of speech.
. During the current campaign for election there is much verbiage.
I try to reduce this verbiage by the candidates to: How does it affect
our freedoms? For, I think it is basically important for each citizen
to be a guardian of freedom. Under representative government,
proposals of laws and programs can be voted to government that
gives this government our individual freedom. When government
receives our freedom it is transferred into a power of administrators
and to interpretation. We as citizens therefor give up our freedom.
This freedom should be given up only under unusual and extreme
circumstances, for the reason it will be difficult to get back. In
?|eneral individual citizens can best administer peacefully their own
reedoms.
|
I would like to propose that we also elect legislators or school
board members on a ""Total Budget Basis."" Certainly in this day of
statistics our candidates could come up with a dollar appropriation {
over which sum they would vote no appropriation of money. This
would make them really evaluate as representatives of all the
Ceople programs of spending in relation to income. Perhaps it would
elp aliminate some lobbying pressure. The freedom to use the
fruits of our individual labors has been slowly taken from us and
continues each day.
I would like to submit in my opinion that Republican candidates
and moderate School Board candidates will best protect our indi- i
vidual Freedoms. Apply the ""Freedom Test"" before voting.
Sincerely,
james k. McCracken.

ballot, one of which directly af
fects the county.
The first question would allow
a change in the procedures and
legal requirements for land con
demnation in Baltimore City.
The second question is a pro
posal to change the number of
signatures required to petition
the General Assembly. As the
law now stands. 10,000 signa
tures are required. The amend
ment would change this to three
per cent of the number of voters
in the previous governor's race.
Third question on the ballot
i concerns the county directly. It
j proposes that procedures for
land acquisition estimates of the
! fair market value of the proper
jty shall be made by a licensed
real estate broker appointed by
the County Council.
Question four concerns a
proposed Increase in pay for
members of the General As
sembly. If approved, the pay
for assemblymen would be in
creased from SI,BOO per an
num to $3,000 and increase
compensation for the presid
ing officers of each house

The final amendment would
provide that a court may im
prison a parent for failure to
comply with a decree for the
support of an illegitimate child

The first question on the
state-wide referenda (No. 6 on
the ballot) seeks to settle a con
troversy over state redistricting.
A 1961 bill for this purpose was
brought to referendum by those
opposing the inequities contain
ed in the legislation.
The second referenda ques
tion concerns a complex and
controversial bill involving
state unemployment laws. Op
ponents of approved legisla
tion say the laws distorts the
basic concept of social secur
ity laws. Proponents of the
law say the bill will plug loop
holes which would reduce the
..Benefit Trust Fund.
A referendum on proposed
regulations to govern the state’s
savings and loan companies is
next. The act regulates non
federally insured savings and
loan associations through a pro
gram of state insurance and
regulations.
The final question seeks to |

Suit Filed
By Negro
A Negro principal in a
Montgomery County elemen
tary school has filed a Fed
eral Court suit seeking to
force two Bethesda develop
ers and builders to stand be
hind an agreement he says
they made to sell him a $26,-
000 “dream house.”
The house is located In a 44-
house development in Seven
Locks Meadow in North Bethes
da, a white neighborhood.
Roland E. Barnes charged that
A. Sind & Associates, Silver
Spring, headed by developer Ab
raham S. Sind and builder-con
tractor Israel Cohen, Bethesda,
violated two agreements in re
fusing to sell him the home.
He also asked for $30,000 dam
ages for breach of contract.
Barnes, principal of Travilah
Elementary School north of
Rockville, claims he signed an
agreement Oct. 7 with the Sind
agent, T. N. Lerner's Harmony
Corp., to purchase the colonial
style house.
Two days later the agreement
and a SI,OOO deposit were re
turned, according to Barnes’ at
torney, Joseph L. Rauh Jr.
When Rauh threatened suit in
early January, Sind and Cohen
are alleged to have signed a sec
ond agreement offering Barnes
tile original house or “an iden
tical home on an equivalent lot”
in the same project.
On July 31, the principal and
his wife were shown a house, ac
cording to the complaint filed in
Baltimore, on a lot that was one
third smaller. The Barnes’ found
the substitute property unac
ceptable.
The suit seeks an injunction
forcing the developers to comply
with the second agreement.

The Winner
Ratus Walters of Sandy
Spring was the chief me
chanic -owner of the car
which won the Darlington
race recently at Cliariotte,
N. C. Sponsored by Presto
lite Division of the Electric
Autolite Company, the race
was witnessed by 40,000 rac
ing fans. Walters’ prize was
a SI,OOO check from the spon
sor. He plans to add a little
to his winnings and buy each
of his three children a SSOO
savings bond.
Chief Judge Roszel C. Thomsen
has ordered a hearing Nov. 15.
The judge also enjoined A.
Sind & Associates from selling a
third house which Barnes had
offered to buy if a few improve
ments were made.
Rauh claims that the defend
ants continually mentioned dur
ing negotiations that the reason
for not selling to Barnes was
that he is a Negro.
The suit charges that the de
fendants asserted that if the
Barneses moved in, the develop
er might lose their financing,
public authorities might ""come
down on them” on zoning, sewer
and water and that potential
buyers might “go elsewhere.”
The developers claim that the
dispute is not a matter of race.
They claim that any customer
might have the same problem.
The defendants claim that the
first agreement was merely a
written offer to purchase which
A. Sind & Associates declined to
accept. The defendants say they
did meet the terms of the sec
ond agreement on an equivalent
house.
According to the second agree
ment, the complaint charges, the
defendants are now liable for
damages of SIOO a day from
Aug. 31, the deadline for pro
viding the “equivalent” house.
Barnes said he picked the
house because it is near his
work as well as that of his wife
who is a specialist on children
I with defective vision with the
j county school system.
The Barneses now live at 310
| Allison St., NW, a round trip
1 distance of some 44 miles from
Travilah Elementary School.
The disputed house is about a
j 12-minute drive from Seven
I Locks Meadow.
“Perhaps this suit will help
j clarify that contracts bind Ne-,
groes and whites alike,” Barnes
! said.
Sunday afternoon Mr. and
Mrs. Roy R. Hunt and Mr. and j
| Mrs. William B. Wheeler were
j hosts to several hundred at a
J sumptuous party at the Hunt
home. Drayton in Spencerville.
Gov. J. Millard Tawes and Dan
iel B. Brewster who is a candi
date for the U. S. Senate, were
! the honor guests. Many other
I Democratic candidates at the

ed beautiful materials which
were all hand woven and ex
plained that weaving, one of the
oldest arts in the world, was
practised in India too far back
to trace. In the late 17th century
cotton material was exported to
England and then returned to
India for printing. Then the art
of weaving was lost until Gand
hi advocated revival of home in
dustries, especially cloth weav
ing, as a method of raising his
country to former standards.
Nearly everyone has a loom in
the house now, and fine cotton
is used by rich and poor alike.
Silks and wools woven so fine

shown made into saris, blouses

in the northwestern six counties

Flathead, Lake, Mineral, Missoula

some gains. In 1961 in those six
counties they held only three of
the 14 House seats. In 1963, they
have won six, to cut the Republican
margin from 11-3 to 8-6.

Democrats hold every single Senate

Trustees' Bookie! Shows
Social Security Solvent
Charges by opponents of the Social
Security system that its trust funds
are ""insolvent"" or are being used ""for
other purposes"" are refuted in a new
booklet published by the trustees of
the funds.
A simplified treatment of the an
nual report to Congress last February,
the booklet reports that income of
the trust funds into the long-range
future is expected to be enough to
cover all costs of the old-age, sur
vivors and disability program. Thus,
the program is ""financially sound"",
declare the trustees—the secretaries
of the Treasury, Labor and Health,
Education and Welfare.
School Enrollments
Up 7,300 Over Same
Time Last Year
The October 1 enrollment in Mon
tana's public elementary and second
ary schools was 156,999, up 5%
from the same date last year, State
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion Harriet Miller announced this
week.
Miss Miller said that the figures
just reported by all of the state's
school districts showed not only an
increase over last year's enrollment
but showed sqme 2,000 more pupils
actually enrolled than had been esti
mated for this fall.
Last year on October 1, the
schools reported 149,706 pupils. From
all indications, this fall's enrollment
was expected to be about 150,000,
but instead it is just one pupil short
of 157,000.
..
Instead of the expected in
crease of 5,300 pupils, the schools
reported nearly 7,300 more than
last year,"" the State Superintend
ent said.
Miss Miller said the figures come
from official reports made by all
school districts for the purpose of
gaining state accreditation. She em
phasized that the figures represent
only those pupils enrolled on Octo
ber 1, and are not the same as year-|
end totals or average number be
longing figures used for state aid
purposes.
The 156,999 pupils are distributed
among the grade as follows: kinder
garten, 3,201; grade 1, 15,482; grade
2, 14,608; grade 3, 14,228; grade 4,
14,074; grade 6, 13,599; grade 6,

Indicted On Price
Fixing Charges
American Public Power Association
A Federal Grand Jury in Philadel
phia, last week indicted six major
manufacturers of aluminum conduc
tor cable on charges of participating
in an unlawful conspiracy to fix
prices.
The firms are Aluminum Co. of
America, Pittsburgh; Anaconda Wire
& Cable Co., New York; General
Cable Corp., Perth Amboy, N. J.;
Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Sales,
Inc., Oakland, Calif.; Olin Mathieson
Chemical Corp., New York, and Reyn
olds Metals Co., Richmond, Va.
The grand jury charged that be
tween Junq, 1958 and August, 1960,
the six companies carried out an
agreement to fix, stabilize and main
tain uniform prices for aluminum
conductor cable. Competition
been suppressed'' and customers have
been unable to buy in a competitive
market, it was alleged. All six of
the firms denied the charges and in
dicated that they will contest them
in court.
The indictment said that in 1959
the six firms sold about $70 million
worth of aluminum conductor cable,
90% of the total domestic market.
Earlier, in New York, five steel
company executives who had pleaded
no contest to charges of conspiracy
to, fix prices and rig bids on steel
forgings were fined a total of $44,
000 by Federal Judge Sylvester J.
Ryan. Judge Ryan at the same time
refused to accept pleas of no contest
by four corporations and a trade
association similarly indicted in con
nection with the sale of steel forgings.

Montana Economy Shored
Up By Federal Spending
(Crowded out by lack of space, Last Issue)
By SEN. MIKE MANSFIELD
Montana received $2.10 in federal funds for every $1.00
it paid to the federal government in fiscal year 1962.
The growing importance of federal expenditures to the
State's economy was highlighted in figures just released by
the nine Cabinet-level departments and four independent agen
cies operating in Montana. These agencies dispensed a grand
total of $346,321,832 in goods and services, while the Internal
Revenue Service was collecting $162,892,000 in taxes from
individuals and businesses.
The ratio of expenditures to re
ceipts was roughly 2.1 to 1, top
ping by a considerable n\argin the
1961 ratio of 1.8 to 1, The figures
released by the agencies included
all expenditures-not only in di
rect grants, but for salaries, goods
and services.
Military spending accounted fo'r
the greatest part of the increase. The
Defense Department expended a rec
ord $135.5 million, an increase of
nearly $60 million over the previous
year. The bulk of this was devoted
to expansion of air base facilities in
Great Falls and Glasgow and con
tinued construction of Minuteman
missile sites across central Montana.
AGRICULTURE SECOND
LARGEST
Montana's second largest federal
customer was the Department of Ag
riculture, which spent $76.7 million
in its multiple programs. This was
a decrease of some $4 million from
the 1961 figure.
In third place was the Commerce

while the public group has spent only
one-fourth as much.

are for sale to the biggest spender.
Such a standard would be unthink

He said Nez
* .
SAME ARGUMENT USED
AGAINST GRAND COULEE
• Levy also found that the public
group had failed to establish a mar
ket for the power output of Nez
Perce. Owen Hurd, WPPSS mana
ger, recalled that electric company
officials opposed Grand Coulee Dam
because ""there's be no one to use it
except jack-rabbits.
Perce power will be needed ""as quick
ly as it can be brought on the line.

""This gratuitous suggestion-for
which there's no support in the
record-can only encourage pri

litigation threats to thwart public
development,"" said Radin. Under
this theory, ""the side with the big
gest battery of lawyers and the
greatest skill in legal harrassment

Under the Federal Power Act, non

Department with expenditures of
134.9 million, much of which went
to the State in the form of aid for
highway construction. The Depart
ment of the Interior was a close
fourth, with $31.7 million. Other
agencies making substantial contribu
tions to Montana's economy were the
Veterans Administration, $27 mil
lion; the Department of Health, Edu
cation, and Welfare, $14 million, and
the Post Office Department, $11 mil
lion.
Official estimates by the agen
cies for 1963 expenditures indicate
that the 2 to 1 ratio will be main
tained, although the grand total
may be somewhat below that of
fiscal 1962. The main factors in
the reduced total is expected to be
the cutback of some $39 million
by the Defense Department, re
flecting completed construction of
Minuteman missile installations.
Some of the larger projects author
ized for 1963 will include $2.5 mil
lion for further development of fa
cilities in and around Glacier Na
tional Park, $5.5 million for the Mis
sion 66 program in Yellowstone Park
and $735,000 for construction of an
airport at West Yellowstone, $5.7
million for construction of a new
court house and federal building in
Billings, $12 million for construction
of Yellowtail Dam, $5.6 million for
Construction of the East Bench recla
mation project at Dillon, and $395,

Young Formers
Union Leader
Goes to Egypt
GREAT FALLS—Larry Holtz, 25,
one of the younger leaders in Mon
tana Farmers Union, is one of five
American farmers who arrived in
Cairo, Egypt, yesterday for a month
long visit. The Egyptian safari is
sponsored by' Farmers and World
Affairs, Inc., as part of its farrp

out the nation on legislative and edu
cational tours. *
The four other farm leaders in the
group are;
Carl Empie, Cochranville, Pa.,
Farm Bureau; Harold S, Huey, Plym
outh, Ill., National Rural Electric Co
operative Association; Fred Wencel,
Longmont, Colo., Grange, and Wal
ter F. Wilmarth, Kingsley, Pa., Farm

Farm Journal. The group will be
joined in Cairo by Harry E, Codlin,
field representative for FWA, who
spent a month in Egypt last summer
making arrangements for the trip.
To know is not to be wise. Many
men know a great deal, and a're all
the greater fools for it. There is

Senator to ask
pipeline for coal
WASHINGTON (UPI) - Sen.
Frank E. Moss, (D-Utah), said
today that energy could be trans
ported from Utah to southern
California more cheaply by a
coal pipeline than by electric
powerlines.
Moss made the statement in
announcing that he would again
co-sponsor legislation to give the
right of eminent domain to com
panies operating coal pipelines.
He said the Consolidation Coal
Co., which has proposed a coal
pipeline from Carbon County,!
Utah, to southern California, had
informed him that a coal pipe
line also would require less water
than a steam generating plan

Company offfcials said they
could build a coal pipeline 10

eminent domain, but told Moss
they could select more economic
routes if they had such right.
Moss said opening of the Pa

“could mean a new era of pros

Utah.”
Predicts move
fo solidly South
I for '64 election
ALEXANDRIA, La. (UPI) -
i A Shreveport editor said a move
i “is definitely underway” to so
lidify southern states for the 1964
presidential election.
George W. Shannon, editor of
the Shreveport Journal, told a
Lions club meeting here that the
election of Gov. George Wallace
in Alabama seems to have pro
vided the spark needed “to re
vive the fight for constitutional
government.”
Shannon said the secret of the
southern movement was to sup
port favorite sen candidates and
withhold electoral votes from
bath the Democratic and Repub
lican candidates until the elec-1
tion becomes deadlocked in the
House of Representatives.
He said in the House, conser
vative Republicans could be ex
pected to join with southern j
Democrats to elect a conserva
tive southerner as president and
a conservative Republican as
vice president.
Shannon referred to Sen.
Strom Thurmond as a conserva
tive southern Democratic leader
with sufficient national stature to
be elected president.

Conservatives
are classified
BIRMINGHAM <UPI) — A Cor
nell University professor says
American conservatives must
keep their cause from the hands
of “extremists” such as John
Birch Society leaders.
Dr. Clinton Rossiter compared
leaders of the Birch group at the
opposite end from Communists
or “extremists of the left.” ’
Rossiter said John Birch presi
dent Robert Welch and other
“extremists” are “too bitter, too
violent, too angry at many of us.
They violate all the rules con
servatives would follow. They are
trying to sell us a bill of goods
which is not American.”
The professor classified four
types of American conservatives:
—The ‘‘over-adjusted conserva
tive” who accepts the great
changes of the past 30 years and
is Willing to take them further
as long as he can control them.
—The ‘‘adjusted conservative”
who accepts the changes, but
would not have pushed them.
—The “unadjusted conserva
tive” who refuses to accept the
changes, is sorry they started,
and wants to roll back history for
at least a few years.
—The “maladjusted conserva
tive” “who operate on the fringe
as an extreme group, who appear
to be at war with America, and
for whom the whole 20th Century
was a mistakke.”
Rossiter said his four types
were typified, respectively, by
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New
i’ork, fcorner President Eisen
hower, Sen. Barry Goldwater,
(R-Ariz).', and Welch.

Waterway funds
may be enough
to finish study
Swep T. Davis, executive di
rector of Pat Harrison waterway
ecarx-niission said today that the
board of directors, headed by
Harvey West of Hattiesburg, is
pleased with an allocation of j
$150,030 included in the presi-1
doat’s proposed budget for 1934.
Davis said that this sum indi
cates a stepped up effect by the
corps of engineers which added
to tiie $103,000 1933 grant amounts
to one-half of the total $500,000
estimated by the Corps for th«.
entire study.
The original Bill authorizing a
permanent waterway district was j
amended to provide only a one- j
laJf mill assessment by each
ounty effected instead of the ori- j
iinal 2 lA mills.
The State will still allocate two
mills and the combination of this :
milSage is considered adequate'
for 'file needs of the development
in its initial years, Davis said.
A second change brought about
in the amendment is in the ma
chinery of establishing the per
manent district of the lccd level
which will fix the onehnlf mill
levy from ea:h participating!
county through decree of the
chancery court.
This decree will provide that all
property owners, qualified elect
ors, and alii other persons inter
ested be notified and they shall
have the right to petition for am
election concerning the matter.

Plymouth once again proves all-around superiority against
its competition. Handling, safety, performance, economy
—all of these were measured in the second meeting of
Ford, Chevrolet and Plymouth early in December at the
Riverside, Cal., test course. In a “Showdown” asked for
by Plymouth, a 1963 Plymouth Fury V-8 whipped a com
parably equipped Chevrolet Impala V-8 and Ford Galaxie
“500” V-8 in eight out of ten official tests.
Nationwide Consumer Testing Institute bought the cars,
hired the drivers, supplied the officials, made and enforced
the rules. The chart at right leaves no question about the re
sults. Plymouth excelled in all-around performance and

House Rules Committee
Moves in on Junketeers
By ROBERT K. WALSH
Star Start Writer
The House Rules Committee
started a crackdown today on
what It regarded as foreign
travel abuses and expense ac
count cover-ups by some other
House committee members and
staff employes.
It adopted two far-reaching
amendments which it Intends
to attach to resolutions asking
House permission and funds for
committee study trips abroad
or within the United States.
Committee Chairman Smith.
Democrat of Virginia, proposed
the amendments at a meeting
of his committee today. He
told newsmen the move was
not provoked by any specific
junket by a House committee
He would not comment., how
ever. when asked whether his
move was hastened by com
plaints about a European study
trip last summer by Represent
ative Powell. Democrat of New
York, chairman of the Educa
tion and Labor Committee.
Amendments Explained
One of the amendments
would apply to House commit
tee* with jurisdiction to make
trips only within the United
States. This amendment would
specifically prohibit such com
mittee chairmen, members or
staff employes not only from
going abroad at public expense
but also from using local cur
rencies owned by the United
States in foreign countries.
Mr. Smith said he had heard
of several Instances in which
members of some committees
took foreign trips for study or
THE FEDERAL SPOTLIGHT
Kennedy Tax Plan Would Raise
Levies on Many Retired Employes
By JOSEPH YOUNG
Star Staff Writer
President Kennedy's tax pro
posals would adversely affect
many Federal employes when
they retire, as well as many
already retired.
The President's plan would
take a bitter tax bite out of
many civil service annuities by
removing present exemptions
Particularly hurt would be
the nearly 33 per cent of Fed
eral workers who retire on dis
ability annuities
At thg present time they pay
no tax on their annuities until
they reach the regular retire
ment age. This is because dis
ability retirement annuities are
classed as sick pay. which is
not taxable on the first 1100
a week.
However. Mr Kennedy's pro
posal would abolish the sick
pay tax exemption
62-Year-Olds Hit
Also. Government employes
on regular retirements would
In many cases pay higher tax
es on their annuities between
the ages of 55 and 85 under
President Kennedy's proposals
In some cases, they also would
pay higher taxes on annuities
after age 65
The reason is that the plan
would abolish the <1.524 an
nual tax deduction retired Gov
ernment workers now get at
age 55 as well as the extra
<6OO exemption each for an
employe and his spouse that
they now receive. It wouldn't
be until age 65 that Mr Ken
nedy would give retired em
ployes a <3OO tax deduction.
The reason Federal workers
would be particularly hard hit
Is that civil service retirement
annuls are aubject to Fed
Investigation purposes and used
such so-called counterpart
. funds to pay expenses. He said
i this apparently was done in
i some cases although the com
mittee in question was not
■ clearly authorized by the House
I to make foreign trips.
The second amendment
Would apply to committees
; having jurisdiction for foreign
: travel. It would permit the
use of counterpart funds but
would greatly tighten require-,
ments for their use and dis
closure.
I ""No member of said com
i mittee shall receive or spend
1 local currencies for subsistence
1 (in foreign countries 1 in excess
: of the maximum per diem rates
approved for overseas travel as
' set forth in the Standardized
* Government Travel Regula
; tions.” the amendment stated.
Smith Explains Move
Mr. Smith explained that this
would make members of Con
gress and committee. employes
subject to the same per diem
, expense rates applying to other
Government employes on for
eign travel missions.
Under present House regula
tions, committee members or
l employes are supposed to sub
mit expense reports to their
■ committee chairmen. This usu
ally is not done in an itemized
■ manner and the reports are
not necessarily made public by
I the House Administration Com
mittee.
I The Rules Committee’s
1 amendments, if approved by
1 the House, would require that:
“Each member or employe of
eral income taxes while Social
Security is not.
The President’s tax propoaala
to Congress were necessarily
general in nature, and it could
be that the administration will
propose safeguards to protect
Federal annuity holders.
However, the situation is
causing concern among em
ployes and retired personnel.
When hearings are held by
the House Ways and Means
Committee on the President's
proposals. employe leaders
would be well advised to watch
the situation closely.
Examples Given
Here are some examples of
how Federal annuitants would
fare under the proposals:
At present, employes who re
tire on disability annuities do
not have to pay Federal in
come taxes unless their weekly
annuity averages somewhat
more than SIOO a week, until
they reach the regular age of
retirement. Under Mr. Ken
nedys proposal, they would
be subject to Federal Income
taxes,
A hypothetical emptoye aged
62 with a wife receives an an
nuity of $3,000 a year. At
present, his various tax exemp
tions wipe out his taxes and
he pays nothing. Under Presi
dent Kennedy's plan, he would
, pay $270 next year and, even
l with the graduated tax reduc
-1 tion the following year, he
, would have to pay $220 in tax
. es in 1965.
A single person drawing a
Federal annuity of $3,000 at
age 62 under the preaent ays
-1 tern pays slls in Income tax
a year Under the Presidents
: plan he would pay S3IR

Close Alliance Necessary
For U. S., Europe, Rusk Says
Br the AtsoeUUd Prcu
The United States will continue to press for a unified
Europe and close United States-European economic and mili
tary relations, says Secretary of State Rusk. i
He said there would be no change in that policy unless
there are changes in the policies of the Soviet Union.
Mr. Rusk asserted the policy of a unified Europe Was
""compelled by the necessities
of our situation.""
Despite French President de
Gaulle's opposition to certain
American-backed proposals. Mr.
Rusk said he believes Europeans
have pretty much the same
goals—a ""grand design of the
West.”
History and the hard fact of
Russian ambitions demand it,
Mr. Rusk said yesterday in a
television isterview (NBC, Meet
the Press).
Mr. Rusk described West
German Chancellor Adenauer
as “one of the greatest of
Europeans,” and said the Ger
man leader had been working
on two projects: The unifica
tion of Europe and the recon
ciliation of France and Ger
many.
The Secretary of State said,
""We hope very much Chancel
said committee shall make to
the chairman an itemized re
port showing the number of
days visited in each country
whose local currencies were
spent, the amount of per diem
furnished and the cost of
transportation if furnished by
public carrier, or if such trans
portation is furnished by an
agency of the United States
Government the agency shall
be identified. All such reports
shall be open to public inspec
tion.”
Hits “Family Tours”
Mr. Smith and other Rules
Committee members said this
amendment would prevent a
House member from taking his
family on a foreign travel mis
sion at public expense.
Mr. Smith said he was confi-
I dent the House will approve
, the two amendments. He said
he discussed the matter in gen
eral with Speaker McCormack
! and with House Administration
' Committee Chairman Burleson,
I Democrat of Texas.
. Representative Powell capped
[ his 1962 summer tour of
, Europe by issuing a 103-
. page printed report on possible
; European Common Market ef
fects on wages and jobs in this
country.
He gave principal credit to
’ staff aides and Library of
of Congress specialists for
| producing the report from “the!
mass of raw data, notes on in-,
terviews, and piles of publica
tions and statistics gathered on
this trip.”

tee. Mr. Powell explained last >
year that they would assist

equal job opportunities for
, women in Europe.
Study Defended
According to hews stories of
the eight-week tour they visit
ed several European countries,
. traveled by air and steamship,
and stayed at plush hotels.
In a short preface to the
printed report, Mr. Powell de
j fended the study mission as a
necessary and valuable means
; of getting information for the
Education and Labor Commit
tee. He explained that much
of the material came from “of
i ficial sources” but private
’ sources and organizations j
: sometimes were ""found more;
t useful.”

MURRAY'S WARNING -
1 Chairman Murray of the Houae
. Civil Service Committee has
warned Government depart
, ments and agencies that his
, group will keep a close watch
, on any further practices that
, inflate Federal salaries by gtv
, Ing employes higher grades!
than the jobs’ duties and re
sponsibilities Justify.
The Tennessean compliment
s ed President Kennedy for his
j order to agencies to stop such)
upgrading practices, and said
his committee will keep cloae
' tabs on the bureaus to see that
5 they comply.
Now that the new Federal
\ pay reform law haa been en
* acted to establish comparabll-
J lty between Government and
r Industry pay. the Government
' must lake pains to classify its
3 Jobs according to what they
r are worth and not any higher,
Mr Murray aald.
3 He expressed concern that
■ the number of top Fed ral ca
rreer Jobs - those in grades 13!
' to 18 has Increased by 58
3 per cent since 195*
■ There are now 86.500 such
3 Jobs, compared to 50,000 five
1 years ago The percentage of,
grade 13 to 18 Jobs In Oovern
* ment has increased from 5 $ to <
' 8.3 during that period.
Mr. Murray said some of the
» increase was Justified by the;
t Government's increased respon
- sibilitles in technological and
x profeaaional fields But he said
s that not all of the Increase in
the higher-paying Jobs could be
r Justified on that btyik
i
lor Adenauer will not have to
' choose between these two great
> objectives.
Asked if Gen. de Gaulle
1 might turn to the Soviet Union
! in his effort to eliminate the
1 United States presence in Eu
, rope and keep Britain out of
the Common Market, Mr. Rusk
■ said:
[ ""It is premature to try to
1 judge in great detail his ideas
about the futture.”
But Mr. Rusk said he does
r not believe the strategy of the
■ Atlantic Alliance could be
' changed short of a ""major
' change” in the policies of the
Soviet Union.
He added that the United!
States does not foresee any
Soviet changes, “so I see no
alternative to continuing the
strength of the NATO Alli
ance.”
Study Group Reports
j
But while Mr. Rusk was say
ing there would be no change
in basic United States policy in
i regard to Europe while ""we
, have ... the confrontation of
’ power in the world ... “a presi- \
< dential fact-finding group said
j Europe should provide more of
illts own defense or risk a re
i; duction of United States mil
l i itary aid.
i The report came out as the
head of Gen. de Gaulla’g pollti
cal party accused the United j
States of trying to control Eu- j
I ropean foreign policy and de-1
ijfense.
Commenting on Gen. de
! Gaulle's opposition to Britain's
entry into the Common Market!
i and his rejection of a proposed
NATO nuclear force in favor
of French developed and con
trolled nuclear weapons, Mr.
|Rusk said:
“Just as we have never our
selves wanted to dominate Eu
rope ... I am quite sure that
Europe does not wish to be
dominated by any particular
country. So it seems to me that
this great Western community
has been moving on, despite the j
fact that at one time or an
other one country or another
has had different views on a
particular aspect of it.
“I think this movement is
required by the historical sltua-1
tion. It is supported by the
wishes of the peoples concerned
throughout both continents and
therefore I think we can ex
pect the general movement to
continue.”
Senators Ask Revision
In a report to the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
yesterday, four Senators sent
to Europe by President Ken-1
jnedy last fall said the United
States should drastically revlae
it policies unless Western Eu
rope contributes more to its
own defense and to ading un-1
derdeveloped nations.
It is ironic, said the report,
that the defense of the West I
should be of ""more intense
concern” to the United States
than to the Western Europeans, j
The report sharply criticized

and their reluctance to in
crease contributions to Europe’s
defense.
“It would appear most ad
visable for the United States
to develop a high degree of
alertness to change in its ap
proach to Europe,"" the report
concluded.
""Except for West Germany,”
the report said, “the tendency
among our allies for a long
time has been to shrink or, at
best, to maintain the status quo
insofar as their commitments
to NATO are concerned.”
“If the Europeans believe
that peace can be sustained
without the addition of prom

there is no reason to reject the
possibility that it can be main
tained with fewer American di
visions in Europe,” the report
added.

st. paul recorder.,['Saint Paul'],1963-02-07,"Negro Union Members
Have Responsibility
AFL-CIO labor leaders have been quick to point
out In their controversy with the NAACP that the
Negro trade unionists also have a responsibility to
work within the labor movement to end race dis
crimination by trade unions.
It is not enough for the Negro trade unionists
to point out the long fight which A Phillip Randolph
and Milton Webster of the Pullman Porters Brother
hood have put up within the trade union movement,
and the many rebuffs they have received from the
leaders of organized labor like AFL-CIO President
George Meany.
The formation three years ago of the American
Negro Labor Committee was the direct result of the
failure of the AFL-CIO to come to grips with the
race discrimination situation with even ""the deliber
ate speed"" suggested by the U.S. Supreme Court In
the school segregation cases.
Despite all of this, when the AFL-CIO leader
ship suggests that Negro trade union members have
an Individual responsibility to become active In their
unions, they are on sound ground. Dues paying mem
bers who never show up at a meeting except around
election time and often not then, need not expect
by their mere presence on the membership books
of the union to exert Influence against race discrim
ination in their own union or other unions.
In the Twin Cities the only predominantly Ne
gro labor union Local 516 does not hold membership
In the St Paul Trades and Labor Assembly and
neither does the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Por
ters.
Whatever the reason these unions are not affil
iated with either of the Twin City labor bodies, It
would seem at first glance with no knowledge of
the reason at hand, that such affiliation certainly
should be maintained in the Interest of the Negroes
who are dues paying members of those unions and
others.
Unions like other American organizations in
business and Industry are overly suspicious of ""out
siders"". This places upon Negroes who carry union
cards a large responsibility for helping change those
policies of which the organized labor movement is
accused—by doing their Job within the labor union
The Taconite Issue:
Let Minnesotans Decide
There are two things wrong with the taconite
tax amendment which has been brought to life again
as a result of an agreement between the steel in
dustry and the United Steelworkers.
The first is that the state constitution is not the
place for legislation. The constitution should be a
body of fundamental law. Ours already contains too
much legislation, which Is one reason for the per
ennial drive to amend it and ""bring it to date"". The
provisions in the constitution that tend to get out
of date are the legislative provisions, like the tac
onite amendment.
The second is that the move for the taconite
amendment has its origins and being In the Industry
that expects to gain a great deal from It Special-
Interest legislation Is not of course unheard-of. Nor
la It necessarily undesirable, though it surely should
be scanned very carefully. In this Instance, however,
the steel Industry is asking for a most remarkable
bit of special consideration and Is offering absolute
ly nothing In return, not even the promise of a tac
onite plant.
The high pressure means by which a body of
public opinion has been built up and certain groups
dragooned Into line on this issue is a matter which
should give every citizen cause for serious concern.
Up to now the basic decisions on this proposed
amendment appear to have been made in Pittsburgh.
When Minnesota gets around to making its de
cisions, we trust that they will be quite different
We don't believe that the average Minnesotan wants
to let the big steel corporations amend our constitu
tion.
WCCO-TV Airs The
Inoculated Milk Controversy
WCCO-TV performed a service recently, on Its
late news program, that is of much greater im
portance than may appear to moat listeners. This
was its report on Minnesota's best-kept health sec
ret, the use of inoculated (immunized) milk in com
batting a number of Ills.
Although the possibilities of Inoculated milk in
combatting hay fever, asthma, and some forma of
arthritis, and other ills were first observed by Univ
ersity of Minnesota scientists many years ago, a
full-scale University study of the matter has been
successfully opposed by organized medicine. And
even today, according to WCCO-TV Minnesota's

health commissioner would forbid the use of in
oculated milk if he could.
This Is surprising, because even if no benefits
could be shown from its use, It is well established
that no harm can come from it. There are no side
effects, as with the so-called wonder drugs. Indeed,
all milk probably carries anti-bodies produced by the
cow as a natural process of combatting Infection.
These anti-bodies survive pasteurization, ordinary
cooking, butter-making, the cheese-making, and most
other manufacturing processes. And this may be
one reason why families using dairy products ex
tensively In their diets are often so free of infec
tions.
What the University scientists did was to In
duce the cow to produce specific anti-bodies to com
bat specific ills, by injections In the cow's udder.
The result is that many sufferers from asthma and
hay fever are able to get relief during the season.
Indeed, the fame of Minnesota’s milk has spread far
and wide, despite the silence conspiracy; and hordes
of tourists come here every summer to enjoy its
benefits. In addition, many a sufferer from arthritis
has seen his affliction cured.
Some doctors, defying the dictum of the medical
powers that be, are now trying the Inoculated milk
method on cancer and multiple sclerosis patients,
among others. They are cautious about making
claims, but some of them do report that they are
encouraged by results In such cases.
To the ordinary layman, It is puzzling why all
the stops have not by this time been pulled for re
search In this area. Why has the University of Min
nesota in the biggest dairying state of the United
States, dragged its feet in the investigation of the
meaning and potential benefits of this unique quality
of milk? Why, indeed, have not the discoveries al
ready made received the nation-wide attention that
they deserve?
Perhaps a few boosts and nudges, such as the
WCCO-TV report will start to get the matter proper
attention.
Pleading The Highway
Department Guilty
Partisans of Highway Commissioner Marshall
have up to now successfully opposed Representative
Fred Clna’s move for an Investigation of charges
that the State Highway Patrol enforces a quota
system upon the patrolmen In the issuance of arrest
tickets. They might as well have pleaded guilty for
the highway department If the department were in
nocent, its friends and apologists would have been
eagerly demanding the opportunity to prove the
charges groundless.
The airing of the charges at this time gives
substance to a suspicion which many a motorist has
held during most of the time that General Marshall
has been highway commissioner.
A traffic ticket, unless the motorist is willing to
spend the great amount of time and considerable
amount of money necessary to fight it beyond the
local court. Is a permanent black mark on the
driver’s record. It places In Jeopardy his very right
to drive. In many of our suburbs and sometimes
even in some of our larger cities, these tickets are
handed out rather freely, even carelessly or irres
ponsibly. Until recently, the state highway patrol
has been considered above this sort of thing. But
things appear to many drivers to have changed, and
now we are given a possible reason why.
One other curious thing: about the Cina charges
is their implied reflection upon the local courts. A
quota system, a system of handing out a fixed min
imum of traffic violation charges, must rely heavily
upon judges who will back up the system. Otherwise,
traffic courts would be clogged with the cases of
motorists and there are a great many—who feel
that they have been unjustly charged and want to
defend themselves. One phenomenon noted on our
state highways during the past year is Une-ups of
four to eight cars that have been halted by the pa
trol for wholesale ticketing. The patrol must have a
lot of confidence that the judge who gets such cases
will be in the ""proper"" frame of mind for judging
them. If he is inclined to give weight to pleas of
innocent, then such cases must go next time to
other judges with opposite inclinations, or the sys
tem breaks down.
We hope that this whole matter gets a thor
ough airing.
Baring The Fact
A survey by a University of Minnesota student
has determined that 68 per cent of the male stu
dents don’t wear hats, while 35 per cent wear some
kind of covering against the cold. The hatleas cus
tom is a local invention, and serves to differentiate
native Minnesotans from those who come from
other climes and believe the rumor that it's cold up
here!

This action on the part of the

the part of the union to recognize
their real problems. The mining
companies argue that cheap labor

Venezuela, places Minnesota in an

What Minnesota must therefore do,
according to the mining compan

there would be greater incentive
for the companies to mine Minne
sota.
The United Steel Workers Union
should have taken the following
factors into consideration for a
possible key to a solution to their
problem before the situation on the
Range became critical. Specific
dangers of the taconite am end
mend will be discussed in a later
column.
(1) The present Instability of
the Venezuelan government. Be
cause of the extremely low stand
ard of living of the peasantry In
Venezuela, Venezuela is In constant
danger of revolution.
If a revolution would occur,
American mining companies would
lose this prime source of iron ore.
Because of this unstable situation,
they would attempt to take out of
Venezuela as much of the ore as
possible even though It were more
expensive to mine than the ore of
Northern Minnesota.
During this time, however, they
would be expected to use this im
portation of ore as a weapon to
secure themselves beneficial condi
tions on the Range. The taconite
amendment attempts to guarantee
that Minnesota will be benefitted
as little as possible from Its own
natural resources If at any time
restrictions are placed on Venezue
lan ore.
(2) The relevance of the condi
tions of the working class of Vene
zuela to those of Minnesota. As
suming that the sole reason for the
Imports of ore from Venezuela is
because It is cheaper, why is it
cheaper ? One reason is because
the miners In Venezuela are merely
being paid a pittance for their
labours. The United Steel Workers
Union should only support candi
dates for public office who are in
terested in raising the living con
ditions of Venezuelan miners. Now
in effect what they do la support
candidates who wish to maintain
competition by lowering the level
of American miners to that of the
Venezuelan miners.
(8) Lack of a steel Industry
within Venezuela. If the mining
companies would permit Venezuela
to have Its own steel Industry,
Venezuelan ore could be used with
in Venezuela and not shipped to
the United States to compete with
the ore from Minnesota.
The reason for this lack of In
dustry is obvious. The low wages
within Venezuela create an un
stable situation which makes in
vestment of capital by the corp
orate Interests dangerous. The pa
radox Is that these corporate In
terests axe also the ones who pay
the low wages that create the un
stable situation. Because of the
stable situation within the United
States, the ore is shipped to the
United States. It certainly should
be in the interests of the United
Steel Workers Union to search for
solutions to this paradox. As It Is
now, the union Is merely an unwill
ing tool of the mining companies
against the Interests of the miners
and the state of Minnesota.

Governor Says Editorial Should Have
Mentioned Elimination Of Head Tax
Editor: In your January 24 Is
sue you had an editorial on the
Tax Study Committee’s report.
Tou failed to menUon one of their
very significant recommendations.
The committee recommended as a
high priority tax reform the elim
ination of the minimum Income tax
of *lO. This so-called ""head tax”
required people who file an Income
tax return and owe any tax at all,
however small, must pay a mini
mum of *lO,
This hits low income people In
a very inequitable way and felt
that this could have well been
mentioned as one of the Items that

""So-Called"" Religious Radio
Broadcasts Disturb Him;
Gibberish Blatant Appeal
Editor: One of the things that
caused me to leave St. Louis and
Chicago were those alleged religi
ous broadcasts put on by some
predominantly Negro groups which
disturbed the peace and quiet of
dignified radio worship, on Sunday
and were nothing more than bed
lam over the air, disgracing the
entire race.
In the past two years of resid
ence here we have been pleased by
the regular broadcasts of one local
church but every time we hear the
half-illiterate appeals to emotional
instability of another weekly
broadcast, we immediately turn off
the station. In the two years we’ve
been here this particular broadcast
has not Improved one lota.
The familiar gibberish, the blat
ant appeal for funds and the un
grammatical bleatings all set up
a bad image for the Negro com
munity.
It's too bad such programs can
not be kept off the air but I sup
pose traditional American free

LIKED EDITORIAL ON
ABSENCE OF BLACK
CUBANS IN FLORIDA
Editor: I am tardy in writing to
inform you how much I enjoyed
your editorial of January 4, en
titled: How Does The Cuban Ne
gro Stand On Castro? Your edi
torial asked a question my wife
and myself have been pondering
for months. We have no love for
Communism, of any variety, but
we've been worried because most
all of the Cubans we’ve seen in
news reels, on TV and in news
paper photographs have shown
only the white Cubans who are
against Castro. However many
blacks who are shown are usually
all around Castro, the bearded tool
of the Soviet.
Even after your editorial the
question hasn’t been answered
completely because we still have
only visual evidence that most of
Castro's enemies appear to be the
well-to-do Cuban ‘whites’ who
helped prior Cuban administrations
exploit the Negro Cuban peasants.
I wonder if this is the answer?
Some of the ""well heeled” Amer
ican Negro newspapers and press
associations ought to send report
ers down to Cuban and find out the
real story as to how the Cuban
Negro minority feels about the
Castro regime, and why.— F. K.
Jones, St Paul, Minn.
BASEBALL FAN THANKS
PAPER FOR QUERY ON
CAMP SEGREGATION
Editor: I am one of the Minne
sota Twins fans who has attended
an average of three home games
a week since we’ve had Big League
baseball. A longtime baseball fan,
I realize Just what “a shot in the
arm"" the presence of Negroes in
Organized Baseball was for a game
which was becoming less the great
National Pastime.
Until the hassle began three
years ago about the disgraceful
discrimination against the Negro
players In Spring training, I was
really naive about baseball train
ing camps in the South. I had no
idea what Negro players had to
put up with and was indignant
that the fat managements of the
clubs put up with such conditions.
The daily baseball writers never
wrote a blooming line about it
I was happy to see our Governor
Andersen take a strong stand
ONE MAN
Page 2, St. Paul RECORDER, Thursday, February 7, 1963
We ple&u „ not . _ the best circulation record keeping
in the newspaper business. In fact to be perfectly frank, if things don’t
improve, we may have to make some drastic changes.
Mrs. Myrtle Royster, South High school teacher, who drew the
first editorial cartoons for us way back in 1934 has not been getting
her paper regularly. A couple of weeks ago she came by the office and
very meekly asked for the two back copies she had missed. If we had
been her, we would have been coldly Indignant at our sloppy system, but
she was kind and understanding.
You can imagine our chagrin when on Saturday morning last,
she called and told us she had not received the paper for two weeks
—again. She still was pleasant and we assured her we would personally
deliver her the two back issues, which we did.
Stephen Maxwell, the assistant Ramsey county attorney of sly, dry
wit, another subscriber complained some weeks ago that while he was
a paid up subscriber the address name plate printed on his weekly copy
had him in arreaips several years. We told him in somewhat abashed
fashion that our record keeping in the circulation was way behind and
promised we would immediately have the situation complained of recti
fied. Now, he told us the other night at the St. Paul Urban League
board meeting he now receives two copies of the paper!
Of course there are errors when you weekly mail out hundreds of
newspapers. There are changes of address which many subscribers fail
to notify us about and many other things which happen which are
frustrating to both subscribers and the management. However in the
final analysis much of it is due to lack of application of the staff and
the paper’s management which means your humble correspondent
We could plead lack of staff personnel. Or that there’s little that
we can do about this until business warrants more staff. We are not
contending that we’ve had the proper dedication, or that either of these
circumstances are the chief reasons why some of the things happen to
papers mailed out to subscribers.
What we are announcing is that we are going to do better by the
customers who pay $5 per year for this sheet, in the matter of circula
tion service. We are not blaming anybody, but the person who writes
this piece each week.
While we are on the subject of circulation, we ought to point out
that despite the increase in postage we do not contemplate a raise in
our circulation rates. It would be nice if mail subscribers paid their
bills promptly (when they finally get them) because the new postage
rates almost eat up all we make off the yearly subscription.
If on top of that fact we have to send four or five notices or re
newals due the clerk hire and 5c first class postage play havoc with
the net.
Howell Distributing Co., distributors of this newspaper and a
tremendous line of cosmetics has a new truck. It’s a handsome Chevro
let job, and we are as happy as we can be that the veteran salesman for
this paper and Jet Magazine has invested in good transportation to get
to his numerous customers. Infatigable Herbert (Herb.) Howell and
his aide Ercel Chadwick are good hard workers and an asset to the
Twin Cities. They are on hand through bad weather or good, sleet, snow
or ice to get this publication to newstands, and newsboys every week
and have never missed an issue. This new truck of their’s, a picture of
which we’ll have in the paper soon, is really something!—Cecil Newman.
against discrimination against our
Negro Twins last year and was
most happy to see last week in
the daily press your query to the
Twins about what Calvin Griffith
and his organization is doing this
year to halt the disgraceful prac
tices.
I was one of those who helped
Hubert Humphrey when he was
mayor stop the deplorable bowling
alley discrimination in Minneapolis.
I am glad to see Governor Ander
sen and others fighting against the
treatment of our colored mfembers
of the Minnesota Twins.
Calvin Griffith ought to be
ashamed to remain in a city where
all of his players can’t be together
for their lodging and meals con
tract or no contract Doesn’t he
know that the morale of the Negro
players must suffer under such
conditions ?
I don’t believe the Twins man
agement did their best to change
the situation in Orlando, Fla. No
long statement can explain the
virtual connivance between the
Twins and the bigots in Orlando
to embarrass both their Negro
players and the thinking white
players on the team by continuing
the segregation in the training
camp hotel accomodations.

minneapolis spokesman.,['Minneapolis'],1963-02-07,"Negro Union Members
Have Responsibility
AFL-CIO labor leaders have been quick to point
out in their controversy with the NAACP that the
Negro trade unionists also have a responsibility to
work within the labor movement to end race dis
crimination by trade unions.
It is not enough for the Negro trade unionists
to point out the long fight which A. Phillip Randolph
and Milton Webster of the Pullman Porters Brother
hood have put up within the trade union movement,
and the many rebuffs they have received from the
leaders of organized labor like AFL-CIO President
George Meany.
The formation three years ago of the American
Negro Labor Committee was the direct result of the
failure of the AFL-CIO to come to grips with the
race discrimination situation with even ""the deliber
ate speed” suggested by the U.S. Supreme Court in
the school segregation cases.
Despite all of this, when the AFL-CIO leader
ship suggests that Negro trade union members have
an individual responsibility to become active in their
unions, they are on sound ground. Dues paying mem
bers who never show up at a meeting except around
election time and often not then, need not expect
by their mere presence on the membership books
of the union to exert influence against race discrim
ination in their own union or other unions.
In the Twin Cities the only predominantly Ne
gro labor union Local 516 does not hold membership
in the St. Paul Trades and Labor Assembly and
neither does the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Por
ters.
Whatever the reason these unions are not affil
iated with either of the Twin City labor bodies, it
would seem at first glance with no knowledge of
the reason at hand, that such affiliation certainly
should be maintained in the Interest of the Negroes
who are dues paying members of those unions and
others.
Unions like other American organizations in
business and industry are overly suspicious of ""out
siders”. This places upon Negroes who carry union
cards a large responsibility for helping change those
policies of which the organized labor movement is
accused—by doing their job within the labor union
The Taconite Issue:
Let Minnesotans Decide
There are two things wrong with the taconite
tax amendment which has been brought to life again
as a result of an agreement between the steel in
dustry and the United Steelworkers.
The first is that the state constitution is not the
place for legislation. The constitution should be a
body of fundamental law. Ours already contains too
much legislation, which is one reason for the per
ennial drive to amend it and “bring it to date”. The
provisions in the constitution that tend to get out
of date are the legislative provisions, like the tac
onite amendment.
The second is that the move for the taconite
amendment has its origins and being in the Industry
that expects to gain a great deal from it. Special
interest legislation is not of course unheard-of. Nor
is it necessarily undesirable, though it surely should
be scanned very carefully. In this instance, however,
the steel industry is asking for a most remarkable
bit of special consideration and is offering absolute
ly nothing in return, not even the promise of a tac
onite plant.
The high pressure means by which a body of
public opinion has been built up and certain groups
dragooned into line on this issue is a matter which
should give every citizen cause for serious concern.
Up to now the basic decisions on this proposed
amendment appear to have been made in Pittsburgh.
When Minnesota gets around to making its de
cisions, we trust that they will be quite different
We don’t believe that the average Minnesotan wants

WCCO-TV Airs The
Inoculated Milk Controversy
WCCO-TV performed a service recently, on its
late news program, that is of much greater im
portance than may appear to most listeners. This
was its report on Minnesota’s best-kept health sec
ret, the use of inoculated (immunized) milk in com
batting a number of ills.
Although the possibilities of inoculated milk In
combatting hay fever, asthma, and some forms of
arthritis, and other ills were first observed by Univ
ersity of Minnesota scientists many years ago, a
full-scale University study of the matter has been
successfully opposed by organized medicine. And
even today, according to WCCO-TV Minnesota's

health commissioner would forbid the use of in
oculated milk if he could.
This is surprising, because even if no benefits
could be shown from its use, it is well established
that no harm can come from it There are no side
effects, as with the so-called wonder drugs. Indeed,
all milk probably carries anti-bodies produced by the
cow as a natural process of combatting infection.
These anti-bodies survive pasteurization, ordinary
cooking, butter-making, the cheese-making, and most
other manufacturing processes. And this may be
one reason why families using dairy products ex
tensively in their diets are often so free of infec
tions.
What the University scientists did was to in
duce the cow to produce specific anti-bodies to com
bat specific ills, by injections in the cow's udder.
The result is that many sufferers from asthma and
hay fever are able to get relief during the season.
Indeed, the fame of Minnesota's milk has spread far
and wide, despite the silence conspiracy; and hordes
of tourists come here every summer to enjoy its
benefits. In addition, many a sufferer from arthritis
has seen his affliction cured.
Some doctors, defying the dictum of the medical
powers that be, are now trying the inoculated milk
method on cancer and multiple sclerosis patients,
among others. They are cautious about making
claims, but some of them do report that they are
encouraged by results in such cases.
To the ordinary layman, it is puzzling why all
the stops have not by this time been pulled for re
search in this area. Why has the University of Min
nesota in the biggest dairying state of the United
States, dragged its feet in the investigation of the
meaning and potential benefits of this unique quality
of milk? Why, indeed, have not the discoveries al
ready made received the nation-wide attention that
they deserve?
Perhaps a few boosts and nudges, such as the
WCCO-TV report will start to get the matter proper
attention.
Pleading The Highway
Department Guilty
Partisans of Highway Commissioner Marshall
have up to now successfully opposed Representative
Fred Cina's move for an investigation of charges
that the State Highway Patrol enforces a quota
system upon the patrolmen in the Issuance of arrest
tickets. They might as well have pleaded guilty for
the highway department If the department were in
nocent, its friends and apologists would have been
eagerly demanding the opportunity to prove the
charges groundless.
The airing of the charges at this time gives
substance to a suspicion which many a motorist has
held during most of the time that General Marshal]
has been highway commissioner.
A traffic ticket, unless the motorist is willing to
spend the great amount of time and considerable
amount of money necessary to fight it beyond the
local court, is a permanent black mark on the
driver’s record. It places in jeopardy his very right
to drive. In many of our suburbs and sometimes
even in some of our larger cities, these tickets are
handed out rather freely, even carelessly or irres
ponsibly. Until recently, the state highway patrol
has been considered above this sort of thing. But
things appear to many drivers to have changed, and
now we are given a possible reason why.
One other curious thing about the Cina charges
is their implied reflection upon the local courts. A
quota system, a system of handing out a fixed min
imum of traffic violation charges, must rely heavily
upon judges who will back up the system. Otherwise,
traffic courts would be clogged with the cases of
motorists and there are a great many—who feel
that they have been unjustly charged and want to
defend themselves. One phenomenon noted on our
state highways during the past year is line-ups of
four to eight cars that have been halted by the pa
trol for wholesale ticketing. The patrol must have a
lot of confidence that the judge who gets such cases
will be in the “proper” frame of mind for judging
them. If he is inclined to give weight to pleas of
Innocent, then such cases must go next time to
other judges with opposite inclinations, or the sys
tem breaks down.
We hope that this whole matter gets a thor
ough airing.
Baring The Fact
A survey by a University of Minnesota student
has determined that 65 per cent of the male stu
dents don’t wear hats, while 35 per cent wear some
kind of covering against the cold. The hatless cus
tom is a local Invention, and serves to differentiate
native Minnesotans from those who come from
other climes and believe the rumor that it’s cold up
here!

LOUIS LA UTTER
FRANKLY SPEAKING
By Everett Luoma
The so-called taconite amend
ment bill introduced last Friday in
the Minnesota House of Repre
sentatives appears now to be head
ed for a generally favorable recep
tion. This favor-|MMMMHBBBB
able reception isg
a result of the®/
iron-mining com-S><
panics' bid 1 n ■
their time until? J.-, JP
the United
Workers U n 1 o
was forced to JD /
cept the ■'('
als of the mining Everett Luotna
companies because of the desperate
unemployment conditions on the
Range.
This action on the part of the
union is a result of a refusal on
the part of the union to recognize
their real problems. The mining
companies argue that cheap labor
in foreign countries, especially
Venezuela, places Minnesota in an
unfavorable competitive position.
What Minnesota must therefore do,
according to the mining compan
ies, is give tax concessions so that
there would be greater incentive
for the companies to mine Minne
sota.
The United Steel Workers Union
should have taken the following
factors into consideration for a
possible key to a solution to their
problem before the situation on the
Range became critical. Specific
dangers of the taconite amend
mend will be discussed in a later
column.
(1) The present instability of
the Venezuelan government. Be
cause of the extremely low stand
ard of living of the peasantry in
Venezuela, Venezuela is in constant
danger of revolution.
If a revolution would occur,
American mining companies would
lose this prime source of iron ore.
Because of this unstable situation,
they would attempt to take out of
Venezuela as much of the ore as
possible even though it were more
expensive to mine than the ore of
Northern Minnesota.
During this time, however, they
would be expected to use this im
portation of ore as a weapon to
secure themselves beneficial condi
tions on the Range. The taconite
amendment attempts to guarantee
that Minnesota will be benefitted
as little as possible from its own
natural resources if at any time
restrictions are placed on Venezue
lan ore.
(2) The relevance of the condi
tions of the working class of Vene
zuela to those of Minnesota. As
suming that the sole reason for the
imports of ore from Venezuela is
because it is cheaper, why is it
cheaper ? One reason is because
the miners in Venezuela are merely
being paid a pittance for their
labours. The United Steel Workers
Union should only support candi
dates for public office who are in
terested In raising the living con
ditions of Venezuelan miners. Now
in effect what they do is support
candidates who wish to maintain
competition by lowering the level
of American miners to that of the
Venezuelan miners.
(3) Lack of a steel Industry
within Venezuela. If the mining
companies would permit Venezuela
to have its own steel industry,
Venezuelan ore could be used with
in Venezuela and not shipped to
the United States to compete with
the ore from Minnesota.
The reason for this lack of in
dustry is obvious. The low wages
within Venezuela create an un
stable situation which makes in
vestment of capital by the corp
orate interests dangerous. The pa
radox is that these corporate in
terests are also the ones who pay
the low wages that create the un
stable situation. Because of the
stable situation within the United
States, the ore is shipped to the
United States. It certainly should
be in the Interests of the United
Steel Workers Union to search for
solutions to this paradox. As it is
now, the union is merely an unwill
ing tool of the mining companies
against the interests of the miners
and the state of Minnesota.

Governor Says Editorial Should Have
Mentioned Elimination Of Head Tea
Editor: In your January 24 is
sue you had an editorial on the
Tax Study Committee’s report.
You failed to mention one of their
very significant recommendations.
The committee recommended as a
high priority tax reform the elim
ination of the minimum income tax
of $lO. This so-called ""head tax”
required people who file an income
tax return and owe any tax at all,
however small, must pay a mini
mum of $lO.
This hits low income people in
a very inequitable way and felt
that this could have well been
mentioned as one of the items that
did touch on low income groups.
Your editorial left the impression
that no one could be interested in
any of the recommendations ex

""So-Called"" Religious Radio
Broadcasts Disturb Him;
Gibberish Blatant Appeal
Editor: One of the things that
caused me to leave St. Louis and
Chicago were those alleged religi
ous broadcasts put on by some
predominantly Negro groups which
disturbed the peace and quiet of
dignified radio worship, on Sunday
and were nothing more than bed
lam over the air, disgracing the
entire race.
In the past two years of resid
ence here we have been pleased by
the regular broadcasts of one local
church but every time we hear the
half-illiterate appeals to emotional
instability of another weekly
broadcast, we immediately turn off
the station. In the two years we’ve
been here this particular broadcast
has not improved one lota.
The familiar gibberish, the blat
ant appeal for funds and the un
grammatical bleatings all set up
a bad image for the Negro com
munity.
It's too bad such programs can
not be kept off the air but I sup
pose traditional American free

LIKED EDITORIAL ON
ABSENCE OF BLACK
CUBANS IN FLORIDA
Editor: I am tardy in writing to
Inform you how much I enjoyed
your editorial of January 4, en
titled: How Does The Cuban Ne
gro Stand On Castro? Your edi
torial asked a question my wife
and myself have been pondering
for months. We have no love for
Communism, of any variety, but
we’ve been worried because most
all of the Cubans we’ve seen in
news reels, on TV and in news
paper photographs have shown
only the white Cubans who are
against Castro. However many
blacks who are shown are usually
all around Castro, the bearded tool
of the Soviet.
Even after your editorial the
question hasn’t been answered
completely because we still have
only visual evidence that most of
Castro’s enemies appear to be the
well-to-do Cuban ‘whites’ who
helped prior Cuban administrations
exploit the Negro Cuban peasants.
I wonder if this is the answer?
Some of the ""well heeled” Amer
ican Negro newspapers and press
associations ought to send report
ers down to Cuban and find out the
real story as to how the Cuban
Negro minority feels about the
Castro regime, and why.—F. K.

BASEBALL FAN THANKS
PAPER FOR QUERY ON
CAMP SEGREGATION
Editor: I am one of the Minne
sota Twins fans who has attended
an average of three home games
a week since we've had Big League
baseball. A longtime baseball fan,
I realize just what ""a shot in the
arm” the presence of Negroes in
Organized Baseball was for a game
which was becoming less the great
National Pastime.
Until the hassle began three
years ago about the disgraceful
discrimination against the Negro
players in Spring training, I was
really naive about baseball train
ing camps in the South. I had no
idea what Negro players had to
put up with and was Indignant
that the fat managements of the
clubs put up with such conditions.
The daily baseball writers never
wrote a blooming line about it.
I was happy to see our Governor
Andersen take a strong stand
Page 2, Minneapolis SPOKESMAN, Thursday, February 7, 1963
CORNER
We plead guilty to not having the best circulation record keeping
in the newspaper business. In fact to be perfectly frank, if things don’t
improve, we may have to make some drastic changes.
Mrs. Myrtle Royster, South High school teacher, who drew the
first editorial cartoons for us way back in 1934 has not been getting
her paper regularly. A couple of weeks ago she came by the office and
very meekly asked for the two back copies she had missed. If we had
been her, we would have been coldly indignant at our sloppy system, but
she was kind and understanding.
You can imagine our chagrin when on Saturday morning last,
she called and told us she had not received the paper for two weeks
—again. She still was pleasant and we assured her we would personally
deliver her the two back issues, which we did.
Stephen Maxwell, the assistant Ramsey county attorney of sly, dry
wit, another subscriber complained some weeks ago that while he was
a paid up subscriber the address name plate printed on his weekly copy
had him in arrears several years. We told him in somewhat abashed
fashion that our record keeping in the circulation was way behind and
promised we would immediately have the situation complained of recti
fied. Now, he told us the other night at the St. Paul Urban League
board meeting he now receives two copies of the paper!
Of course there are errors when you weekly mall out hundreds of
newspapers. There are changes of address which many subscribers fail
to notify us about and many other things which happen which are
frustrating to both subscribers and the management. However in the
final analysis much of it is due to lack of application of the staff and
the paper’s management which means your humble correspondent.
We could plead lack of staff personnel. Or that there’s little that
we can do about this until business warrants more staff. We are not
contending that we’ve had the proper dedication, or that either of these
circumstances are the chief reasons why some of the things happen to
papers mailed out to subscribers.
What we are announcing is that we are going to do better by the
customers who pay $5 per year for this sheet, in the matter of circula
tion service. We are not blaming anybody but the person who writes
this piece each week.
While we are on the subject of circulation, we ought to point out
that despite the increase in postage we do not contemplate a raise in
our circulation rates. It would be nice if mail subscribers paid their
bills promptly (when they finally get them) because the new postage
rates almost eat up all we make off the yearly subscription.
If on top of that fact we have to send four or five notices or re
newals due the clerk hire and 5c first class postage play havoc with
the net.
Howell Distributing Co., distributors of this newspaper and a
tremendous line of cosmetics has a new truck. It’s a handsome Chevro
let job, and we are as happy as we can be that the veteran salesman for
this paper and Jet Magazine has invested in good transportation to get
to his numerous customers. Infatigable Herbert (Herb.) Howell and
his aide Ercel Chadwick are good hard workers and an asset to the
Twin Cities. They are on hand through bad weather or good, sleet, snow
or ice to get this publication to newstands, and newsboys every week
and have never missed an issue. This new truck of their’s, a picture of
which we'll have in the paper soon, is really something!—Cecil Newman.
against discrimination against our
Negro Twins last year and was
most happy to see last week in
the daily press your query to the
Twins about what Calvin Griffith
and his organization is doing this
year to halt the disgraceful prac
tices.
I was one of those who helped
Hubert Humphrey when he was
mayor stop the deplorable bowling
alley discrimination in Minneapolis.
I am glad to see Governor Ander
sen and others fighting against the
treatment of our colored members
of the Minnesota Twins.
Calvin Griffith ought to be
ashamed to remain in a city where
all of his players can’t be together
for their lodging and meals con
tract or no contract. Doesn’t he
know that the morale of the Negro
players must suffer under such
conditions ?
I don’t believe the Twins man
agement did their best to change
the situation in Orlando, Fla. No
long statement can explain the
virtual connivance between the
Twins and the bigots in Orlando
to embarrass both their Negro
players and the thinking white
players on the team by continuing
the segregation in the training
camp hotel accomodations.

Supreme Court and 'Local Riots'
Action by Congress to Prevent Tribunal's
Acting in Such Cases Is Urged
On Monday of this week,
the Supreme Court of the.
United States ruled that 187
persons arrested in Columbia,
S. C., for “breach of the
peace"" were merely exercising
their rights of free speech
when they engaged in a
picketing demonstration
against segregation, and that,
even though city officials
thought a riot was imminent,
the police should, in effect,
have waited until someone
got hurt before recognizing
it officially as a riot.
On Tuesday of this week,
United Press International
carried a dispatch from
Miami, Fla., as follows:
“An American Nazi wear
ing a khaki uniform and
swastika armpatch was
hauled off to jail today when
his picketing at the Anti-
Defamation League of the
B’nai B'rith drew an angry
crowd.
“Police said if 21-year-old
David Howard Peterson of
Minneapolis had not been
taken into protective custody,
violence would have erupted
ih the crowd of 150 that
gathered shortly after the
picketing began.
“Peterson, who admitted
being a member of the Ameri
can Nazi Party, carried a
sign saying: ‘Communism is
Jewish, ADL (Anti-Defama
tion League) is Jew Secret
Police.’ ”
Maybe the Miami police
didn't have time to read the
Supreme Court decision.
Maybe they were not yet
aware that the “law of the
land"" now is that name-call
ing, defamation of any race
or religion, or incitement to
violence cannot be stopped
by arrests until fighting
actually starts and injuries or
deaths occur.
Justice Tom Clark, who
was the only member of the
high court to uphold the
doctrine that a threat of
violence can be checked by
the police, had this to say
in his dissenting opinion on
Monday:
“To say that the police
may not Intervene until the
riot has occurred Is like
keeping out the doctor un
til the patient dies.”
JOSEPH KRAFT
Confusion Over the Cuban Affair
Lack of Administration Co-ordination,
Not Any Goof in Operation, Is Blamed
The administration hag
handled the domestic politics
of its Cuba problem with un
usual clumsiness. As a result
confusion has been com
pounded. But that is not to
say that there was a goof in
operations, or a “photo gap,”
or a jurisdictional fight be
tween the CIA and the Air
Force, or even that Senator
Keating is a prophet.
What has been wrong with
the administration approach
has been a lack of co-ordina
tion. For one thing, it has
allowed post-mortem inquiries
on Cuba to become the prop
erty of a gaggle of different
Congressional committees—
none of them with clearly
defined terms of reference.
There is Senator Dirksen’s
one-man Investigation. There
is the investigation of the
Senate Preparedness Sub
committee under Senator
Stennis. There are inquiries
by subcommittees of the
House Foreign Affairs and
the Senate Foreign Relations
Committees. It has been ru
mored that Congressman
Hardy’s Government Opera
tions Committee Is consider
ing the possibility of an in
vestigation of the Cuban
policy of the Eisenhower ad
ministration. The admini
stration’s attention to the
problem has been so lax. that
it seems not even to have
taken steps to ' block the
appointment of one of its
sharpest and most irrespon
sible critics—Senator Thur
mond of South Carolina—to
the Stennis subcommittee.
It is also becoming clear
that the administration has
been speaking with several
voices. One of the principal
administration witnesses has
been the CIA Director, John
McCone, a Republican who
DORIS FLEE SON
• A Busy Day for Mrs. Johnson
Her Activities in West Virginia Today
Recall Feats of Eleanor Roosevelt
It must have seemed like
old times in West Virginia
today.
A gracious woman from
the highest Washington cir
cles flew in and addressed
herself to the first fruits of
the Kennedy administration
effort to improve economic
and social conditions in the
areas.
Mrs. Lyndon Johnson did
not go down a coal mine as
Eleanor Roosevelt did nearly
30 years ago, but her 14-hour
d«y was faithful to the pat
tern recorded in the most
famous diary ot modem
times.
It began when she turned
the first shovel of earth for
the new county library in
the suburbs of Charleston, a
project of the Area Redevel
opment Administration. Her
own large gift of books in
cluded—but of course—Pro
files In Courage, autographed,
and others autographed by
men.
Justice Stewart, speaking
for the majority of the high
est court in the land, said:
“The State courts have
held that the petitioners’
conduct constituted breach
of the peace under State law,
and we may accept their de
cision as binding upon us to
to that extent. But it never
theless remains our duty in a
case such as this to make an
independent examination of
the whole record. And it is
clear to us that in arresting,
convicting, and punishing
the petitioners under the cir
cumstances disclosed by this
record, South Carolina in
fringed the petitioners’ con
stitutionally protected rights
of free speech, free assembly,
and freedom to petition for
redress of their grievances.”
The episode took place on
the grounds of the State
House while the legislature
was actually in session. Jus
tice Clark studied the same
record and testimony. He
pointed out that nearly 200
demonstrators marched with
placards bearing slogans
such as “Down With Segre
gation” and ""You May Jail
Our Bodies But Not Our
Souls."" and then proceeded
to stir up the trouble. He
added:
“The activity continued for
approximately 45 minutes
during the busy noon-hour
period, while a crowd of
some 300 persons congregated
in front of the State House
and around the area direct
ly in front of its entrance,
known as the ‘Horseshoe.’
which was used for vehicular
as well, as pedestrian ingress
and egress. During this time
there were no efforts made
by the city officials to hinder
the petitioners in their
rights of free speech and
assembly; rather, the po
lice directed their efforts
to the traffic problems
resulting from petitioners’
activities. It was only after
the large crowd had gathered,
among which the city man
ager and chief of police re
cognized potential trouble
makers. and which together
with the students had be
come massed on and around
was one of the beakiest of
the hawks during the week
long deliberation which pre
ceded the Cuba quarantine
last October. Mr. McCone
apparently has been intimat
ing that he felt as early as
August and September that
the Russians were putting
offensive missiles into Cuba.
Another of the principal
administration witnesses has
been Defense Secretary Mc-
Namara. He has beery at
great pains to show that the
first indisputable evidence of
offensive missile bases on
Cuba came through the
photos taken by the U-2
overflight of October 14. To
drive home the point, he
showed the last previous
photos of the exact same
area photos which were
taken on a flight of Septem
ber 5, and which showed no
offensive missile sites. As a
result there has grown up the
theory of the ""photo gap""
which supposedly existed be
tween September 5 and Octo
ber 14. This theory lends
itself to a view dear to the
critics of the administration,
and which seems to fit in
with Mr. McCone’s testimony.
Namely, that the administra
tion failed to press home
photo surveillance at the
critical moment either be
cause of negligence, or be
cause of a jurisdictional bat
tle, or because it wanted to
delay the crisis until the eve
of elections.
The facta are very differ
ent. Through most of 1961
and 1962 U-2 flights over
Cuba were going on at the
rate of two a month. In Sep
tember, 1962, the rate was
increased to four per month.
The flight of September 5
covered the western part of
the island where offensive
She next handed out re
training certificates to for
mer coal miners now em
ployed as meta) workers by
the FMC corporation. Her
next stop was a hospital
where formerly unemployed
men and women who had
been retrained under ARA
auspices today work as tech
nicians.
Her concluding major ef
fort was also in the Eleanor
Roosevelt tradition, she ad
dressed a Charleston dinner
for the woman Democrats
of the State.
Mrs. Johnson's develop
ment as an energizing and
sponsoring force on the so
cial welfare front of an ad
ministration conscious of
what remains to be done has
been apparent for some time.
She brings to it a personal
style markedly Southern,
practical experience in han
dling and expanding a sub
stantial inheritance, and a
sound political instinct. She
has the time to giy^ it as her
the ‘Horseshoe’ so closely
that vehicular and pedestrian
traffic was materially im
peded, that any action
against the petitioners was
taken.
“Then the city manager, in
what both the State Inter
mediate and (State) Supreme
Court found to be the utmost
good faith, decided that dan
ger to peace and safety was
imminent. Even at this junc
ture no orders were issued by
the city manager for the
police to break up the crowd,
now about 500 persons, and
no arrests were rqade In
stead, he approached the re
cognized leader of the peti
tioners and requested him to
tell the various groups of
petitioners to disperse within
15 minutes, failing which
they would be arrested.
“Even though the city man
ager might have been honest
ly mistaken as to the immi
nence of danger, this was
certainly a reasonable request
by the city’s top executive
officer in an effort to avoid
a public brawl. But the re
sponse of petitioners and
their leader was defiance
rather than co-operation.”
Justice Clark noted that
for the next 15 minutes the
petitioners “conducted what
the South Carolina Supreme
Court found to be 'a noisy
demonstration in defiance of
(the dispersal) orders’”
The basic question is
whether the local police have
a right to prevent a riot or
whether they must wait until
casualties actually occur. The
American people have always
felt that local disturbances
are for the States and cities
to handle.
The only available remedy
now is the passage by Con
gress of a law taking away
from the Supreme Court of
the United States any right
to consider cases involving a
breach of the peace when a
State Supreme Court has al
ready passed on the issues
involved. There is precedent
for this type of legislation.
The Constitution itself spe
cifically gives Congress the
right to pass a law limiting
or removing appellate juris
diction from the Supreme
Court of the United States
in such cases as the lawmak
ers may deem desirable.
(Copyrltht. lass)
missile launching sites were
not yet under construction.
Subsequent flights on Sep
tember 17, 26 and 29. and on
October 5 and 7 turned up
nothing, either because the
sites were not yet in, or be
cause the wrong a<-eas were
covered, or because of cloud
cover.
Many scheduled flights had
to be cancelled because of
bad weather. That is how it
happened that the first In
disputable evidence came on
October 14.
It is true, as the White
House has announced, that
on October 6, Air Force planes
were substituted for CIA
planes in the over-flight op
eration. But that came about
not, as has been alleged, be
cause of a jurisdictional fight
which delayed photo opera
tions. The fact is that the Air
Force planes were technical
ly inferior. The change was
made mainly because the Air
Force had more planes avail
able.
As to Senator Keating, the
prevailing confusion has
made it seem that the ad
ministration was either wrong
or disingenuous while he was
right all along. But has It
been all along? And Mas he
been right? His first mention
of offensive missiles in Cuba
seems to have occurred, not
In August and September as
so many suppose, but in a
Senate speech of October 10.
At that time he referred to
“at least a half-dozen launch
ing sites for Intermediate
Range Tactical Missiles.’’ In
fact, only three launching
sites were ever discovered. By
itself the disparity in num
bers may seem unimportant.
But it suggests that the
source of the Senator’s infor
mation was the under-cur
rent of refugee gossip which
looks good in hindsight, but
upon which no responsible
Government can take action
without supporting evidence.

She is helping to fill a

worried Democrats of the

Mrs. Johnson's activities
should be helpful to her hus
band in the area of his
greatest weakness, which is
the big Industrial States. He
was highly approved by the
business interests there for
his pragmatic, conservative
leadership of the Democratic
Congress during six of the
Elsenhower years.
But party workers were
apprehensive of his vote ap

their strength as labor, mi

been working hard to over
come this feeling in the
years before 1968 when he
can again be a candidate for

He has been noticeably
restless in the grip of the
constitutional limitations of
the Vice Presidency but has
managed to keep silent in
public about it. *

Religious Expression in Schools
Free Exercise of Belief Is Considered
The True Issue in Argument
Another spring is to bring
another bitter division within
the Supreme Court and
within the United States—
determining whether any
chemical trace of religious
feeling, however voluntary
and non-sectarian, is to be
allowed expression in the
public schools of the United
States.
The court last June forbade
as unconstitutional the vol
untary recitation in New York
schools of a 22-word non
denominational prayer pre
pared by the school authori
ties. Now it is to decide two
other questions:
Will constitutional govern
ment be threatened if such of
the children of Baltimore as
may care to do so continue to
open each school day with
Bible reading and by repeat
ing aloud the Lord's Prayer?
Will constitutional govern
ment be threatened if such of
the children of Pennsylvania
as may care to do so continue
to open each school day by
hearing a reading of 10 para
graphs from the Bible?
Sessions of the Supreme
Court itself are opened with
an invocation of God's bless
ing upon its work. Public offi
cials. including the President,
traditionally take oath upon
the Bible. The National
Anthem—the one anthem of
every man, woman and child,
whatever his religion or the
lack of it—still recognizes the
existence of God.
All this notwithstanding,
however, the outlook is not
too good for those school
children who wish to partici
pate in ceremonies acknowl
edging that divine mercy and
divine justice still exist in an

THE EVENING STAR
Washington, D. C, Friday, March 1, 1963
rialism and private hopeless
ness.
For the arguments recently
heard before the Justices on
the Baltimore and Pennsyl
vania cases—which probably
will be settled along in June
—have strongly indicated
that some at least intend to
read the doctrine of “separa
tion of church and state” in
such away as to permit God
to be mentioned in the
schoolhouses hereafter only
under one’s breath.
The First Amendment to
the Constitution declares, as
to religion: ""Congress shall
make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise
thereof.” This is where the
doctrine of separation arose.
But surely the true Issue here
is not that someone is trying
to make an ""establishment of
religion”—namely, to set up
one state church superior to
all others.
Surely the true issue in
volved here is involved in
the latter half of that amend
ment. that forbidding inter
ference with the free exercise
of religion.
Any minority, including
the ultimate minority of one
pupil, has the undoubted
right to refuse to participate
in any religious exercise.
This columnist, for one,
would support such a right
to the end. But does a
minority have the right to
forbid the majority such an
exercise, if this be their faith
and choice, on the extraordi
nary argument that if the
majority do choose to pray,
this somehow Invades the
rights of the minority? If so,
what becomes of the second
half of the First Amendment?
If school children violate
the Constitution by voluntary
prayer acknowledging a
divine Being, what of singing
The Star Spangled Banner
in school, having in mind
its explicit acknowledgment
that “in God we trust?”
Is respect for tradition it
self to be declared unlawful,
on the ground that some
people reject tradition? If
one child chooses to pray,
does he really make “an es
tablishment of religion""? How
in God’s name—if the ex
pression may be pardoned—
does he harm the child who
does not wish to pray? Even
if, as atheists claim in im
measurable sadness, faith is
only a legend, is it in any
way ugly? Are beauty and
gentleness and tenderness
also to be declared unconsti
tutional?

Passman Disgusted
^CONGRESSMAN OTTO PASSMAN, the Louisiana Democrat
^ who heads a House subcommittee which supervises foreign
aid, has just returned from a trip all over the world—a trip de
signed to appraise the country’s aid program.
What the hard-fighting Congressman has to say is of interest
to every American taxpayer: in brief, he is thoroughly disgusted
with the aid program.
One of the aims for which our money is going, in some
countries, is to finance private or parochial schools. In this case
and in others we have the spectacle of State Department or other
appointees deciding that American tax money will be used out
side our borders for purposes which are specifically barred by the
Constitution, inside our borders.
By now the foreign aid system has gained solid entrench
ment in the way of employes, a bureaucratic organization fighting
for its life and for retention of jobs, and backers who have profited
from these yearly expenditures and who will continue to profit
from them.
Our Peace Corps has worked well. This is aid to nations by
human beings working on very low salaries. This is the best form
of aid; it is understood; it is aid from the heart and in leadership
and technical ways that can improve a nation’s people and their
making of a living. This is the kind of aid we can expand. The
old money give-away should be terminated as quickly as possible.
Passman, no doubt reflects the will of the majority of the American
people.
It Can’t Happen Again
THE YEARS HAVE BEEN so crowded with events that it is
hard to realize that thirty have passed since the bank holiday,
""the day the money stopped” by decrees from Washington, But
they have and Caroline Bird recalls in Look the courage, tragedy
and humor of March 6, 1933.
Yes, there was a bit of humor. For one thing the late John
D. Rockefeller, Sr., ran out of dimes and had to give his golf
caddy a dollar. There were novel ways of continuing business.
In Atlanta, a taxi driver accepted postage stamps. In Buffalo,
a winning prize fighter received his purse in potatoes and toma
toes. All of us who were alive then have stories of our own.
According to the article, this cannot happen again. Federal
Deposit Insurance, paid for by banks themselves, now guarantees
bank accounts up to $10,000. More important, there are fewer
banks, and they are stronger. Economic indicators exist to forecast
trouble.
""Almost everybody,” says Miss Bird, ""now distinguishes be
tween real wealth and the yellow stuff.”
Considering that the United States now owes more gold than
it owns, this is important—if true!
House Turns
Down w4Liberty”
Amendment to
U.S. Constitution
JUNEAU OF) — The House Tues
day turned down a resolution pro
posing a so-called “liberty” amend
ment to the U.S. Constitution by
a vote of 10-27.
The proposed amendment would
prohibit the federal government
from engaging in any kind of
business except as specified in the
Constitution, and ultimately would
prohibit it from collecting personal
income taxes.
The vote came after more than
an hour’s debate which ran past
the noon hour.
Before the final tally, the House
turned down two attempts to
amend the measure.
The first, sponsored by Rep.
Mike Gravel, would have exempt
ed a long list of federal activities
in Alaska, such as the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, public housing,
aid to education, the Army Corps
of Engineers, the Alaska Railroad,
public airports, and the like. That
one went down on a 15-17 roll
call count.
The second amendment, offered
by Rep. John Rader, would have
specifically exempted such power
projects as the proposed Rampart
Dam, and the Bradley Lake and
Snettisham hydroelectric projects.
That one failed by a vote of 13-19.
In both cases, the authors of the
amendments argued that those
who wanted to go along with the
proposed constitutional amend
ment “should realize that they’d
have to live with it at home.”
Rep. Wm. Boardman said that
while many of the lawmakers
might sympathize with the amend
ments, the measure should be kept
uniform since it also was being
considered by other states.
Speaking for the resolution, Rep.
Earl Hillstrand, said that he was
one of the sponsors of the meas
ure “not entirely because of its
contents, but because it is a blow
against something of which I do
not approve—bigger and bigger
government.”
“I fail to grasp the practical ap
plication of this measure in this
day and age,” said Rep. John Holm.
“Perhaps we should have passed
it 50 or 150 years ago. But right
now it has little other than pro
test value.”
In the final vote, those in favor
of the measure were: Reps. Baker,
Boardman, Cole, Hillstrand, Leon
ard, Miller, Parsons, Tillion and
White.
Marie Drake, Author of
Alaska Flag Song, Passes
JUNEAU WP>. — Mrs. Marie
Drake, the author of the words to
Alaska’s Flag Song, died here yes
terday after a long illness.
Mrs. Drake came to Alaska after
the end of World War I and took
employment with the Territorial
Department of Education, rising
to the post of Assistant Commis
sioner in 1934.
She held the post until 1945.
There are no known survivors.

Judge Hubert Gilbert
Gives Resume of
Coming Court Activities
Judge Hubert Gilbert gave a
resume of coming court activities
at the Chamber of Commerce
luncheon which get underway
March 12 here at Superior Court,
with the grand jury which is fol
lowed by trials.
Judge Gilbert stated that the
local court should be active
through March and April with the
amount of work to be done. The
local court is also hearing some
Anchorage cases on tape which
will be acted upon.
He also told of the new state
court buildings which are being
completed this month in Fair
banks and Anchorage which will
facilitate the work of these two
communities. He described the
new courtroom of the Anchorage
building as being very unusual
and compact and in a circular
shape. Rentals on these two facili
ties are estimated to cost the state
$lVfc million a year.
Bob Harwood reported on the
action of the Chamber in its sup
port of the city toward getting
funds for the water and sewage
system and what they have done
about finding out why Nome was
told only a week before it voted
in favor of the project that it
held a high priority due to the
sanitation needs of the community.
Just why sidewalks and other im
provements to another community
was more important is something
that is being inquired into.
Guests at the meeting were
Rev. Benjamin Laird of the
Methodist Church here on a
preaching mission at the Commu
nity Methodist Church and Dr.
Stan Stitt, dentist, of the Public
Health Service.
Supervisory Functions
Of IRS In Anchorage
Will Be Moved to Seattle
WASHINGTON UP) — Some
supervisory functions of the An
chorage Internal Revenue Service
office will be moved to Seattle as
part of a nationwide reorganiza
tion was announced Tuesday.
Treasury Secretary Douglas Dil
lon said the entire revision, af
fecting 12 offices in the nation, is
aimed at saving about $5 million
a year in overhead and adminis
trative costs.
Alaska residents will continue to
file returns in Anchorage and
Mortimer Caplin, IRS Commmis
sioner, said no taxpayer would be
inconvenienced by the change.
Washington Sens. Henry Jack
son and Warren Magnuson said
Caplin reported the Seattle IRS
office staff would be increased “to
some extent.” Caplin said he hopes
reductions at the Anchorage of
fice can be accomplished by trans
fers and normal attrition.
The Anchorage office, he said,
is the smallest in the nation, with
65 employes. The number to be
affected at Anchorage was not
specified.
RUSSIANS WILL
Try to Prevent
Destruction of
King Crab Gear
JUNEAU UP) — Secretary of
State Hugh Wade said Tuesday
Russia has pledged complete co
operation in preventing the de
struction of American king crab
fishing gear by Russian trawlers.
Wade said the assurance was
given by Dr. A. S. Babaev, a Rus
sian delegate to the recent North
Pacific Fur Seal Conference in
Tokyo.
Wade attended the meeting as
a representative of the State of
Alaska.
Babaev, Wade said, denied,
“with great feeling, that any fish
ing Vessel captained by a Russian
sea captain and manned by a Rus
sian fishing crew would deliberate
ly destroy or damage fishing gear
of another fisherman, particularly
an Alaskan fisherman after the
cooperation that has existed be
tween the two fishing fleets over
the years.”
Wade said Babaev told the U.S.
delegates that any incident that
was brought to their attention
would result in complete investi
gation and punishment, if facts
warranted it.
Babaev suggested that the Rus
sians be advised of the type and
kinds of markers used by Alaska
king crab fishermen, the general
area where they are located and
the density of the pots.
He said Russians would then
exercise “great and unusual care”
in these areas. Babaev suggested
that a radio beacon of some kind
tuned to the radio frequency used
by Russian ships be set up to
mark the general area where
American pots are located.
Wade said the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, the U.S. State
Department and the Alaska State
Department of Fish and Game, as
well as the American king crab
industry itself, had agreed to fur
nish information to the Russians
Babaev told Wade he planned to
stop in Vladivostok and notify the
Russian fishing fleet there of his
concern regarding the problem.
American fishermen complained
last year of a heavy loss of king
crab gear caused by the activities
of Russian trawlers which were
operating in the same general
area, off the southern tip of Ko
diak Island.
PROPOSE TRANSFERS
JUNEAU Oft—Two pieces of leg
islation were introduced in the
Senate Tuesday by Nome Demo
crats Lester Bronson and Pearse
Walsh.
The first, SB 130, calls for the
transfer of the Forestry, Parks and
Recreation branch of the Division
of Lands from the Anchorage area
to Juneau.
The other, SB131, would trans
fer the Division of Aviation from
the Anchorage area to the Fair
banks area.

Trial of F. D. R.-Jr.
If the clock could be turned back 30
years It would be hard to conceive of a
Senate committee grilling a man named
Franklin Delano Roosevelt—even with
a Junior attached to the name. Never
theless, a Senate group, or at least the
Republican members thereof, are quiz
zing the late President’s son with a
view to ""marking” his selection by
President Kennedy as Undersecretary of
Commerce.
This does not make any great Im
pression on us. If Mr. Kennedy had
combed the country over he might have
come up with a better candidate for this
post. Back In the rugged days of the
West Virginia Democratic primary, how
ever, F. D. R., Jr., gave a big push to the
presidential ambitions of J. F. K. Mem
ories are long In those West Virginia
hills and the Roosevelt name had not
lost Its magic. It is hard to believe, but
some reporters wrote that voters In the
valleys and little hill towns didn’t know
the difference between F. D. R and F. D.
R., jr. Maybe they didn’t care and maybe
It doesn’t matter. One certain thing is
that the West Virginia primary, on the
Catholic Issue, meant a lot to John F.
Kennedy, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, jr.,
gave him a big assist on that occasion.
The nomination to the Commerce
post, after much scanning of other
possibilities, Is, of course, a political pay
off. But what’s so wrong with that?
Political debts are paid by Republicans
as well as Democrats, and the partisan
alarms which are being raised over Mr.
Roosevelt’s traffic record, his limited
business experience and his service as
legal adviser to Trujillo’s Dominican
Republic leave us singularly undis
turbed. Mr. Kennedy owed a debt to
Mr. Roosevelt; he has tried to pay it,
and we do not think the Senate will
upset this particular political applecart.
There Is one aspect of this matter,
however, which Is a bit hard to swallow.
During the West Virginia primary, Mr.
Roosevelt, In effect, questioned the pa
triotism of Senator Hubert Humphrey,
who was running as Mr. Kennedy’s
Protestant Democratic opponent This
was baseless, and Senator Humphrey,
with ample justification, called It “gutter
politics.” Mr. Kennedy, who might have
repudiated this shabby support, managed
to look the other way. He said Mr.
Roosevelt was making his speeches, and
that he, Mr. Kennedy, was making his
own.
At this late stage of the game it
doesn’t matter much. Mr. Humphrey was
beaten In West Virginia and evidently
has forgiven or forgotten. Mr. Kennedy
went on to win the nomination and the
election. The Republicans are making
partisan noises about It, but the political
debt to Mr. Roosevelt Is being paid. As
for the rest of us, like It or not, this Is
the way of politics In our country.
New Bid on Old Dream
The revolutionary government of
Iraq, In office less than six weeks, is
making an energetic effort to maintain
the present momentum of political
change In the Arab Middle East. To
this end. Its latest proposal foresees a
new Arab union to be built first around
a joint three-nation military command
—lraq, Syria and the United Arab
Republic—but expanding later to politi
cal affairs and to the Inclusion of such
other Arab states as Algeria and Yemen.
In one form or another, federation
of some or all of the Arab countries Is
an old dream that never has been
brought successfully to life. The pros
pects for the present Iraqi formula, which
apparently has not even been worked
out in any detail, are not noticeably
brighter. After all, the problem of In
tegrating sovereign authorities In the
fields of military, political or economic
planning are as intricate in the Middle
last as In any other part of the world
—possibly more so.
In more ways than one, the key
figure In the plan being promoted by
the Baghdad government Is President
Nasser of the U. A. R. It was evident
during the brief Iraqul revolution last
month, and the even faster overthrow
of the Syrian government last week,
Chat the winning forces In each case are
admirers of the Egyptian chief of gov
ernment. There also was evidence of a
similar man-ln-the-street attitude both
in Baghdad and Damascus. And while
Iraq and, to a lesser extent, Syria are
possessed of greater natural resources
than Egypt, the latter country has the
political stability and the technological
abilities that are essential to any ef
fective new experiment In federation.
At the moment, President Nasser
Is reported cautiously receptive to the
Iraqi plan—pending the possibility of
a “summit meeting"" with the heads of
governments In Baghdad and Damascus.
It seems clear enough that none of this
will happen In haste, and that the new
regimes In Iraq and Syria will have both
the opportunity and the responsibility
to demonstrate their qualifications to
govern their own countries before becom
ing a part of a wider regional authority.
No Time to Quit
Representative McMillan’s charge
that the “news media” In Washington
have wrecked the prospects of a mean
ingful Increase In the Federal payment
to the District by too much talk about
the President's proposed Federal pay
ment “formula” Is utter nonsense.
Os course the “news media” have
been enthusiastic about the presidential
proposal. It represents, first of all, an
administration concern with the prob
lems of the Nation’s Capital that Is
vrtually unprecedented. It seeks, sec
ondly, a permanent, long-range legisla
tive solution to the Federal payment
dilemma which Is urgently needed to
restore some degree of sanity to the
fiscal affairs of the District. And,
thirdly, It comes closer In dollar volume
to the real needs of the city than the
less complex and somewhat smaller
Increase proposed by Mr. McMillan.
This does not mean, of course, that
the White House has spoken the last
word, and we are surprised that Mr.
McMillan seems to think the press is
so naive as to believe that Is the case.
For his part, Chairman McMillan has
serious misgivings about the political
feasibility of the President's bill. Per
haps he will be proved right—and The
Star has so stated in the past. But
there obviously Is a sharp difference
of opinion on this question between
responsible members of Congress, which
logically and sensibly should be con
sidered and resolved In the kind of
Joint House-Senate deliberations which
have been proposed by Chairman Bible
of the Senate District Committee.
In his letter to a local radio station,
Mr. McMillan complains that he receives
no “assistance or encouragement” from
the “news media” In his legislative ef
forts on the District’s behalf. Well, as
to that, a number of points might be
raised, Including the fact that except
on rare occasions Chairman McMillan
makes himself totally unavailable to
reporters. Under the circumstances, It
is hardly strange that the position of
the congressman is not always fully
understood.
But what has all this to do with the
fate of the Federal payment proposals?
In our opinion, Congress will be very
little Influenced In what It ultimately
does by the reaction of “news media”
to the White House plan. What Chair
man McMillan does, however, will be
vitally Important, and his current gen
eralized Irritation at the “news media”
is no Justification for a retreat from
his original position that a Federal
program of substantial proportions is
essential to the well-being of the city.
'lnclude Us Out 1
One of the shoddy, time-worn
traditions which discredit the Maryland
Legislature Is a practice that usually
permits delegations to “exempt” their
local areas from the effects of State
legislation distasteful to them. “Include
us out,” they say, and voila!—it is
miraculously done. During the prelimi
nary voting on the Governor’s
machine bill the other day, however, this
unwritten rule suffered one of Its rare
setbacks. It would be pleasant to report
that this resulted from a sudden surge
of moral principle. But that, alas, was
hardly the case.
As a practical proposition, the bill
to abolish slot machines Is aimed only
at those four Southern Maryland coun
ties where the one-armed bandits now
are legal. When an amendment was
Introduced to “exempt” three of these
four counties from the effects of the
bill, therefore, the Legislature faced a
choice which must have pained some of
its elder statesmen. For a vote against
the amendment would strike at least
indirectly at the so-called “local option”
tradition, raising for some, no doubt, the
specter of later reprisals by the “victims”
In this case. If the amendment were
permitted to carry, however, the Legisla
ture and Its leaders would have been In
the utterly ludicrous position of passing
a high-priority reform measure which
would have applied to hardly anyone.
The Legislature made the only sen
sible choice—rejecting the amendment
by the lopsided vote of 93 to 29. Indeed,
the only surprise was that a number of
Delegates from outside the affected
areas (Including, unaccountably, two
from Montgomery County) voted the
other way. As a precedent, however, the
vote was no test at all of sentiment on
the “privilege” of exemption. One can
only hope that on some future occasion
this Issue will be faced on Its merits, and
that eventually “laws of the State” will
have equal application everywhere In
Maryland.-
Good Samaritan
Nancy Leudlcke could not under
stand what all the fuss was about. All
she had done was to give up one of
her healthy kidneys so that George
Brost, 39, might have a chance to live
for his nine children. To Mrs. Leudlcke,
29, It was a quite natural thing to do.
She just happened to read about Mr.
Brest's condition one day while on a
coffee break In Milwaukee. It made no
difference to her that he was a stranger
in Boston, and It made no difference
that her own life might be shortened
by a long-shot gamble that Mr. Brost
would live. To Mrs. Leudlcke there was
only one thing to do, and she did it.

Facts for Goldwater
I suppose I am one of
""those people"" Senator Gold
water seeps complaining
about who are trying to force
him to run for the Presidency.
We are the same people
who took to heart the Sen
ators plea at the 1960 Repub
lican National Convention
that we stay in the party
and work to make our con
servative position the domi
nant one. We would seem to
have done a pretty good job
of it because at the local.
State and congressional level,
the party has definitely
swerved to the right of the
Eisenhower Administration
and the 1960 platform.
The only thing is. this
whole effort is for nothing
if we are stuck with a
pseudo-Republican like Nel
son Rockefeller as our 1964
Presidential candidate. It is a
little disheartening that
while we are out fighting
the good fight to prevent
that from happening, our
Achilles announces from time
to time that he intends to
sit this one out in his tent.
It would be well for Sena
tor Goldwater to take into
consideration a couple of the
facts of life: 1. He can
make brilliant statements
about this Administration’s
shortcomings 24 hours a day,
but unless he says them out
there where the people can
hear him, on the Presidential
stump, they aren’t really go
ing to bring about any im
provement. 3. If Senator
Goldwater, the only conserv
ative of sufficient stature
and personal magnetism
available, chooses not to run,
then Nelson Rockefeller is
the greatest cinch that ever
went to the post.
Now, it could be that Sen
ator Goldwater doesn’t re
gard the nomination of
Rockefeller as the calamity
that the rest of us conserv
ative Republicans do. If that
is true, then either the Sen
ator is greatly misjudging
Gov. Rockefeller or a lot of
conservatives are greatly
misjudging Senator Gold
water.
Jerry Davis.
Little-Practiced Rule
In every international cri
sis, I have wondered why
more people, here and abroad,
can’t apply the Golden Rule
to their country’s actions as
they would to those of an in
dividual. Adlai Stevenson was
accused of willingness to dis
mantle our bases in Turkey
if Russia would dismantle
hers in Cuba; and there was
such r storm of criticism that
he hastened to deny it. Among
the liberals who are demand
ing effective action to over
throw dictators like Duvalier
of Haiti and Nasser of Egypt,
how many would concede a
right on the part of Duvalier
or Nasser to call for boy
cotts and blockades to over
throw our form of govern
ment? We lecture the world
on the Rule of Law but con
tinue to limit our acceptance
of the jurisdiction of the In
ternational Court of Justice.
I grant that we are not
the only ones with this one
sided outlook. India, ever
since her Independence, has
been lecturing the world on
pacifism but using force in
Kashmir. Hyderabad, Kerala
and Goa Every nation has
this fault in some degree.
I do not ask that the na
tions of the world should be
have like saints. But I do be
lieve that if they are not to
exterminate themselves In a
nuclear catastrophe, they
must learn to practice the
Golden Rule at least as well
as the average citizen does.
This means showing some un
derstanding of the needs and
viewpoints of others. It
means a willingness to give
and take in settling disputes,
and the willingness, where
compromise fails, to secure a
decision by a court rather
than by force. It means a
willingness to give and take
in settling disputes, and the
willingness, where compromise
falls, to secure a decision by
a court rather than by force.
It means a willingness to
resolve political conflicts by
some sort of governmental
machinery.
If men can, nations can.

Eisenhower Duck Hunt
1 am enclosing herewith a
copy of my letter to Senator
Fulbright, giving him the
facts regarding Gen. Eisen
hower’s recent hunting trip
in Mexico. I am sure that the
Mexican correspondent was
merely doing enthusiastic re
porting rather than attempt
ing to give an erroneous ac
count of the General’s visit.
The Mexican people were ex
tremely happy and proud to
have him there, and I really
believe that what the Mex
ican reporter was trying to do
was to praise General Eisen
hower to the Mexican people.
Your helpfulneas in cor
recting the bad impression
given by this inaccurate news
report would be greatly ap
preciated.
Charles 8. Jones.
Los Angeles, Calif.
(Editor’s Note: Mr. Jones*
letter to Senator Fulbright
refers to a brief Associated
Press dispatch in The Star
from Cullacan, Mexico, Feb
ruary 25. Senator Fulbright
placed the article in the Rec
ord and made a brief speech,
critical of the report that Mr.
Eisenhower had shot 40
ducks and 35 other birds in
leas than three hours. Mr.
Jones’ letter to Senator Ful
bright is quoted below.)
""Inasmuch as you could
not have been aware of the
gross inaccuracy of the news
story which you placed in the
Congressional Record. I feel
sure you would like to have
the facts in the matter.
“If the newspaper article
had said that ""The Eisen
hower Party Shoots 75 Birds”
—instead of “Eisenhower
Shoots 75 Birds”—it would
have been a more nearly
correct headline. Actually, the
total number of birds was 60.
""Including my own, there
were six guns in a party of
about 20 people, both Mexi
can and United States citi
zens. While Gen. Eisenhower
is an excellent shot, he did
not take his limit of 30 birds,
and the shooting party fin
ished the day with half of a
legal Mexican limit.
""The Laws of the Republic
of Mexico, and I enclose them
for your convenience, per
mit a hunter to shoot 20
birds on Saturdays and Sun
days. and 10 birds on week
days.
""I call your attention to the
fact that the Mexican peo
ple have a duck of their own
which their law describes as
‘resident duck,’ and which
is not migratory, and these
ducks, for the most part,
made up the hunting party’s
bag. There were very few
migratory ducks in the area.
""The Eisenhower party
went to Mexico as guests of
the Mexican government and
were entertained in Cullacan
by as fine a group of people
as one can meet anywhere in
the world.""
Inspects Platform
The 1963 platform of the
Republican Party in Mont-,
gomery County contained
the following statement:
“We favor tax legislation
to encourage the preserva
tion of open spaces and ag
ricultural uses of land. We
are convinced that the pres
ent farm assessment law
fails to fully accomplish
either of these purposes but
serves, in part, as a tax haven
for land speculators. We fa
vor revision of the present
law to correct this situa
tion.”
The county council now
has an opportunity to take
three simple actions which
would go a long way towards
carrying out this pledge.
Urgency to act now stems
from a bill which has been
introduced in the Maryland
General Assembly by Sena
tor Clark of Howard County.
Senator Clark would drop
the present requirement of
the preferential farm assess
ment act that the ""zoning
applicable to the land"" be one
of the criteria used to deter
mine whether or not land in
agricultural use shall be eli
gible to be assessed at a small
fraction of its market value
for the stated public purpose
of maintaining agriculture
and preserving open space.
Yet the zoning criteria is the
only one of 29 in effect which
gives any permanence to ag
riculture, or acts to preserve
open space.
By a small oversight no
one ever specified what zon
ing lot size should qualify the
land for preferential assess
ment. It's right here that the
public purpose of the law to
preserve open space has bro
ken down. Meanwhile farm
ers who ardently supported
preferential assessment on
the grounds that they not be
driven from their land by
high taxes due to rising land
values have bitterly opposed
agricultural or low density
zoning on the grounds that It
would prevent them from
subdividing their farms into
half-acre lots.
What the council could
easily do is this: First: Go on
record against Senator
Clark's amendment. Second:
Request that the Montgom
ery County Planning Board
make a recommendation to
the county’s legislative dele
gation on the proposal of the
planning commission’s staff
that the farm law be amend
ed to require rural or large
lot zoning in addition to ag
ricultural use, for eligibility
to receive preferential assess
ment. If nothing is done this
session, the chance will not
come again for two years.
Third: Declare it to be coun
cil policy that since the in
tent of the preferential farm
assessment act is to main
tain agriculture and to pre
serve open space as an amen
ity necessary to human wel
fare and happiness, that
landowners who have been
receiving special tax benefits
cannot validly object that
the development value or
their property has been arbi
trarily or unfairly reduced if
the council decides to adopt
and implement a general
plan requiring that some
parts of the county now zoned
for half-acre lots be rezoned
for less Intense residential use
compatible with continued
agriculture and providing one
type of needed open space.

Update Security Pacts
In connection with your
editorial regarding need for
a patrol of space for our
safety, I wonder if there is
not a concomitant factor just
as essential: guarding the
free world by barring in it
all Communist tracking sta
tions sites. Orbiting bomus
could be controlled from such
stations. Recently the Soviets
asked Australia for a ""scien
tific” tracking station. It
would seem imperative that
we update our mutual secur
ity pacts with a clause deny
ing such sites to Communists
such pacta as the Rio
Pact, the Antarctic Treaty,
the Anzus, BEATO, and
NATO pacts, etc.

Europa's Drive for Independence
PARIS.
One may fervently hope
that the trips to Europe of
Adlai Stevenson and Secretary
of State Rusk during the
coming month may result in
a clear and coherent state
ment of American policy to
ward Europe.
Such a statement is over
due because the Europe that
is emerging today is, in a
number of watys, rather dif
ferent from what might have
been expected even a few
months ago. And statements
of American policy that
served at an earlier period
now seem painfully outdated
and Inadequate.
The exclusion of Britain
from the Common Market, at
least for the time being, has
served to emphasize the ex
clusiveness if not isolation
ism of the European bloc.
Whether or not they prevail,
the expression of European
aims and objectives supplied
by President de Gaulle of
France square uncomfortably
with the ideas of an ""inter
dependent Western commu
nity” preached by leaders of
the American administration.
Particularly in the military
field, most of the specific
ideas dreamed up by these
leaders in recent months
have seemed hopelessly jut of
tune with the realities as
they appear in Europe. The
suggestion that our allies
should massively increase
their conventional contribu
tion to Western defense has
no serious defenders any
where. The argument that
Europe should be content to
leave its nuclear security ex
clusively in the hands of the
United States is accepted
only by those countries which
lack the capacity for a na
tional nuclear effort of their
own.

Montgomery Beats Rommel Again
ALAMEIN. By C. E. Lucas
Phillips. Maps and dia
grams by Audrey Frew,
photographs, 434 PP (At
lantic-Little, Brown & Co.;
>3.95.)
On the eve of the Battle of
Alameln, the then Lieu
tenant-General Montgomery
Issued a message that ended:
""Let every officer and man
enter the battle with a stout
heart, and with the determi
nation to do his duty so long
as he has breath In his body.
""And let no man surrender
so long as he is unwounded
and can fight.
“Let us all pray that ‘the
Lord Mighty in battle’ will
give us the victory.”
The engagement began on
the night of October 23, 1942.
Twelve days later, “the
breakout had been accom
plished and the hunt was on.""
This desert victory over
Marshal Rommel and the
famed German Afrlka Corps
began the final destruction
of Axis power In North Af
rica.
The tremendous fight is
the subject of an exhaustive
and somewhat technical book
by C. E. Luca* Phillips, ""who
was commander of one of
Montgomery’s regiments” at
Alameln and ended the war
as a Brigadier General.
Certain aspects of the Bat
tle of Alameln have inspired
technical controversy, and
Brigadier Phillips has strong
notions of his own. These
need hardly concern the lay
man, except perhaps for the
discussion of the “Rommel
legend.”
AS BRIGADIER PHILLIPS
sees it, Rommel was simply
not that good. “I have taken
occasion,” he writes ""... to ■
reduce to its proper propor
tions the legendary and whol
ly exaggerated image of
Field-Marshal Rommel. One
of the foundations of Mont
gomery’s victory was his
shrewd and exact apprecia
tion of the mistakes that he .
knew Rommel would make.”
""Alameln” begins with a
vivid description of military
life on the desert and a brief
survey of previous military
activity there. We are then
led through a list of the
units involved and elaborate
disquisitions on some tech
nical problems. Indeed, by
the time he has finished the
first part of the book, the
reader should be able to
gather up some friends and
go out to clear a minefield.
Then, the main subject. At
Alameln, Montgomery
changed the nature of desert
warfare. Instead of employ
ing lightning tank stabs
against prepared positions,
he began with an old-fash
ioned artillery barrage. The
first waves of Infantry fol
lowed the barrage as it began
to roll forward. Only then
did sappers clear paths
through the minefields for
the tanks and self-propelled
guns.
In this way, Montgomery
got anti-tank guns into for
ward positions and proved
""that tanks . . . could no
more advance in the face of
resolutely manned anti-tank
guns than the cavalry of
their fathers’ day could ad-
clear that a multilateral
force in which the United
States retains a right of veto
arouses very limited interest
The reason why these
schemes have been doomed
from the beginning is that
they all have overlooked one
simple central ■ fact about
emergent Europe: That it in
tends to become in its own
right without any qualifica
tion one of the world’s great
powers.
This will be true whoever
calls the tune. It is not, aa
many Americans have been
wrongly led to believe, an
abberatlon peculiar to Gen.
de Gaulle. It is, in fact, pre
cisely because he gives a spe
cial and eloquent expression
to this almost universal idea
that the general stands head
and shoulders above every
other European leader today.
For Independence
Europe, then, will not ul
timately allow its potential
power to be circumscribed or
controlled by the United
States in the name of “West
ern solidarity” or ""interde
pendence.” It will not, in any
joint effort, accept the propo
sition of a junior partner.
It will not be diverted by
schemes designed to per
petuate the dependence of
Europe on American power.
What Europe is heading for
and what it will most cer
tainly one day achieve is a
real alliance of equal part
ners with the United States.
Unless the United States can
accept this goal in every
sphere of international ac
tivity. it will find itself in
creasingly at cross purposes
with strongly - developing
trends in this part of the
world.
Until these basic facts are
assimilated in Washington, it
will be impossible to develop
policies toward Europe that
stand much chance of suc
cess. There are occasions
when the necessity of making
a public statement by an
important official has led to
clarification of policy itself.
If the forthcoming visits
could produce such a result,
it would be gratefully re
ceived in both Europe and
the United States.
vance in the face of quick
firing field artillery.”
Rommel fulled to appreci
ate the point. Again and
again he mounted counter
attacks led by tanks. The
losses he thereby sustained
began the destruction of his
army.
ALAMEIN WAS A HARD,
bloody fight and Brigadier
Phillips follows it in great
detail, sometimes down to
company and even platoon
level. His style is curiously
changeable. Sometimes it
borders on eloquence; some
times It comes uncomfort
ably close to “sick” parody.
Most American readers will
have trouble with the rich
assortment of British mili
tary abbreviations, for while
the glossary Informs us that
a FOO Is a ""Forward Obser
vation Officer (artillery),”
we are left to dredge “VC”
(Victoria Cross) out of our
memories and such things as
“RTR (Royal Tank Regi
ment) out of the index.
These are small faults
compared to the book’s many
virtues. Its maps and tacti
cal descriptions are clear, as
indeed they should be since
Brigadier Phillips has, made
considerable use not only of
the usual sources but also
of unpublished diaries and
has asked innumerable par
ticipants to search their
memories.
""Alameln” is a bloody vol
ume. But no one will feel
that it is an Indulgence of
morbidity. On the contrary,
it is clearly Brigadier Phil
lips’ Intention to celebrate
the healthy bravery of the
courageous men who partici
pated In one of the crucial
battles of World War IL

evening star.,['Washington'],1963-03-26,"Virginia May Get Gas-Storage Site;
Bittinger Hits Maryland Amendments
By DONALD B. HADLEY
■tar Financial Editor
Washington Oas Light Co. is
considering moving its *4O mil
lion project for underground
storage of natural gas from
Prince Georges County, Md., to
another State, probably Vir
ginia
“The company now is rapidly
reviewing an alternate plan for
storing gas underground in an
other State,” Donald S. Bittin
ger. president, told stockhold
ers at the annual meeting yes
terday.
Signs pointed to Virginia as
an alternative site. The com
pany has developed the Ra
vensworth propane storage cav
ern in Fairfax County. Vs. Ar
rangements for this *5 million
project were made in less than
90 days. When it is completed,
later this year, the county will
derive substantial additional
taxes, a company spokesman
said today.
A bill empowering the com
pany to acquire additional
underground rights for its
Brandywine storage project in
Prince Georges County passed
a second reading in the Mary
land House of Delegates yes
terday. However, two amend
ments attached to ,lt were de
scribed by company officials
as raising Insurmountable bar
riers to the continuation of the
project.
Provides Special Tax
One would provide for a spe
cial county tax of IS per cent
on the commodity cost value
of all gas stored in the project
at the end of each calendar
year. This special levy would
be in addition to all normal
taxes on the investment.
A second amendment would
make the company liable for
damages on a very broad scale.
Company officials said Wash
ington Gas would expect to
bear normal liabilities in con
nection with the project, but
pointed out the amendment
provides that it would be liable
for damages without regard to
negligence within an area of
10 miles of the stored gas or
place of injection on the basis
of prime facie evidence.
Mr. Bittinger told stockhold
ers the added 15 per cent tax
could make it Impossible to
continue the project. Another
company official said today
the extended liability amend
ment probably would be just
as much of a factor standing
in the way of continuation.
“At a time when States end
counties all over the Nation
are offering competitive attrac
tions, often in the form of tax
concessions to encourage desir
able development, Prince
Georges County appears to be
moving in the opposite direc
tion by proposing additional
burdensome taxation on the
Brandywine project,” declared
Mr. Bittinger.
*3 Million Invested
To date, Washington Gas has
Invested around *3 million in
the Brandywine project. This
includes the cost of well sites
and a compressor site, but the
largest proportion represents
expenses of geological explora
tion and engineering costs, it is
understood.
The company's legal staff
and engineers are hard at work
studying plans for alternatives
in another State and when
their studies are completed, re
sults will be submitted for. ac
tion to top executives and then
to the board of directors. In
the meantime, officials have
declined to discuss the possible
alternative sites, but have em-

i phasized the pleasant experi
ence with Virginia State and
county officials in establishing
the Ravensworth project.
West Virginia is another
nearby State that may offer
some interesting possibilities as
the company already is oper
ating there as well as in Vir
ginia.
Also at the meeting, Robert
C. Baker, board chairman and
president of American Security
it Trust Co., was elected a di
rector of Washington Gas. He
replaces Daniel W. Bell, former
chairman of the bank, who
served on the board for eight
years.
C&P Earnings Dip,
Revenues Increase
The Chesapeake and Poto
mac Telephone Co. reported to
day a decline in earnings from
*1.83 a share in 1961 to *1.78
a share in 1963 despite a 6.6
per cent Increase in revenues.
In its annual report, the
company added that total reve
nues reached (77.3 million but
that expenses climbed to *53.8
million, an Increase of 9.9 per
cent over 1961.
The gain in expenses was at
tributed largely to a general
wage increase and the hiring of
new employes to keep pace with
service needs.
Operating taxes amounted to
*13.7 million while an addi
tional *5.6 million in Federal
excise taxes, billed directly to
customers, raised the total tax
bill to (19.3 million. These
taxes, the company said, ac
counted for 20 cents of every
dollar billed to customers.
A record sum of more than
*37 million was spent on ex
pansion and modernisation of
buildings, equipment and serv
ices. Both the number of tele
phones in service and local and
long-distance calls originating
from Washington set new
records.
At year’s end, the company
said, there were 679,000 tele
phones in the District, an in
crease of 19X100. Local calls
increased 3.9 per cent over 1961
to a total of 697 million. Out
of-town calls rose 5.2 per cent
to a total of 16.7 million.

DiSalle Named Head
Os New Fairfax Town
Michael V. DiSalle, who was
defeated last year in his bid for
re-election as Governor of Ohio,
will head the development of
Reston, a new community to be
built in northwest Fairfax
County, Va.
The announcement was made
here today by Robert E. Simon,
Jr., of New York, owner of the
7,000-acre tract.
Mr. DiSalle, currently a visit
ing professor of Political Science
at the University of Massachu
setts, will assume his new duties
May 1, according to Mr. Simon.
A spokesman for the Reston
community said the former
Ohio Governor would be in
Washington Thursday to look
over the Virginia property and
to decide whether to make his
home nearby.
Speaking at a luncheon meet
ing of the Advertising Club here,
Mr. Simon said the first lots at
Reston, located near the Dulles
Airport, 18 miles west of Wash
ington, would go on sale early
in May. Construction, he added,
is scheduled to start this sum
mer on 350 housing units and
a village center containing a
14-story apartment building
and stores.
The project was first an
nounced in August, 1961, five
months after Mr. Simon bought
the property, originally owned
by the A. Smith Bowman it
Sons distillery.
Mr. Simon's plan calls for

Eastern Roads to Meet

NEW YORK (DJ).-Some 22
traffic vice presidents for East

Washington tomorrow night in
an effort to end rate “con

Dow Jones learned.
“Coal rates are in a state of
confusion,” said the vice presi

“All we can do is try to clarify
the atmosphere.”

ton and Old Dominion Rail
road.
The project, expected to
take 15 years to develop, en
visions a population of about
75,000 by 1980.
Prom 1951 through 1953, Mr.
DiSalle was director of the Of
fice of Price Stabilization, an
office he established at the re
quest of President Truman. He
served as Governor of Ohio
from 1958 to 1962.
at this time of the year the
utilities are all signed up.”
Many of the Eastern rail
roads like the Western Mary
land, the Reading, the Central
Railroad Co. of New Jersey and
others have not announced
which rate pattern they will
follow that of the B&O or
that of the Pennsy - Central
group.
There are complicated fac
tors such as the point of origin
of the coal involved in the
movements which affect the
picture. But a rail source said
these points will be hashed out
at the Washington conference
and that by this week end a
clearer picture should emerge.

Trust Charges
By Hughes Tool

Pan American World Air
ways in a reply filed with the
Civil Aeronautics Board yester
day to antitrust charges made
by Hughes Tool Co., denied
that any “relationship of con-'
trol” is exercised over it by
three lending institutions— ,
Metropolitan Life Insurance
Co.. Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the United States, 1
and Irving Trust Co.
Pan Am also denied that
Juan T. Trlppe, Pan Am presl- 1
dent, dominates the company 1
or controls its board of direc
tors.
Conspiracy Denied
In addition, the airline de
nied that its proposal to <
merge with Trans World Air
lines is in any sense a “con
spiracy” as charged by Hughes
Tool,
It also alleged that Hughes ,
Tool’s complaint was filed “not (
in good faith but for the pur
pose of attempting to delay
TWA’s prosecution of its suit”
■gainst Hughes Tool and “to
assist Howard R. Hughes to
evade the lawful process” of
the courts.
Hughes Tool, which is owned
by Howard Hughes, for months
has been involved in complex
litigation with TWA over the
78 per cent of TWA stock that
is owned by Hughes Tool, but
since 1960 has been controlled
by a group of banks and in
surance companies. Pan Am
and the present management of
TWA filed a merger agreement
with the CAB last December,
although processing of the
agreement by the board has
been held Up pending clarifi
cation of the tangled court
battle.
CAB Inquiry Sought
Last month Hughes Tool, in
an apparent attempt to move
the battle out of the courts
and into the CAB, asked the
board to investigate alleged an
titrust charges it brought
against present TWA manage
ment and the banks and in
surance companies. Hughes
Tool also named Pan Am and
others in its complaint.
Charles C. Tilling hast, Jr.,
TWA president, in his reply to
the CAB conceded that TWA
and Pan Am compete on some
international routes but de
nied any antitrust violations.
He declared that Hughes
Tool’s complaint is “part and
1 parcel” of Hughes Tool’s “es
; forts to delay a final decision""
i by the courts in the antitrust
, action brought by TWA against
. the Hughes interests.

Social Security Hunts
Many Pension El igibles
By SYLVIA PORTER
At thn J 14 _ ... . _
At the headquarters of the
Social Security Administration
in Baltimore, a computer is be
ing used to help trace hun
dreds of thousands of older
Americans who are eligible to
receive their own paid-up So
cial Security pensions, but who
have failed to apply for them.
You may know one or more
of these individuals or even
may be Involved yourself. If
you have any doubts, check
your status at your local Social
Security office and urge others
to do the same.
The Social Security Admin
istration is trying to locate a
million individuals 65 or over
to see if they’re forfeiting ben
efits to which they're entitled.
Based on a computer survey
of almost 500.000, more than
one in five is doing Just this.
Cards Are Checked
Last fall. Social Security of
ficials started their search by
checking all Social Security
card-holders 67 years of age or
over. The cards of these indi
viduals were first run through
the “mechanical brain"" and
checked against claims filed.
Then the cards of individuals
who had not yet filed for old
age pensions wer' run through
the compute-, again and this
time were matched against the
wage records to find out if the
card-holders were still em
ployed.
Through this process, the
, computer threw out the names
of 496,000 persons 67 or over
i who could not be accounted
for, and the search by the 8o
; cial Security Administration
was on. The task has been ex
ceedingly difficult, for while
the eomputer produces the
, ""leads,"" the Job of finding the
' Individuals concerned is rough.
, The last known address of a
; missing person usually is the
one given when he received his
' card many years ago. It has

meant checking out old ad
dresses, voting records, city di
rectories, post offices, etc.
So far, however, the search
has turned up an impressive
total of 101,300 eligible claim
ants!
This has resulted in the fil
ing of 82,000 old-age claims,
16,000 claims by dependents,
3,300 claims by survivors. The
survivor claims are compara
tively low, because funeral di
rectors across the country fur
nish the Social Security Ad
ministration with the name,
Social Security number and ad
dress of the next of kin of
deceased workers. Thus, the ad
ministration has up-to-date
records on deceased workers,
and has an effective method of
contacting survivors.
Os course, the success of the
search has varied, has been
Importantly affected by the
area in which the individuals
live. In rural sections, officials
have been able to find about
70 per cent of the persons
sought, for they often are still
living in the same town or
nearby, are well-known in the
region. In other sections, how
ever, urban redevelopment has
so uprooted neighborhoods that
officials can’t even find the old
neighborhood, much less the
Individuals concerned.
The search is Just beginning.
Officials have now run a one

computer to make a continuing

though from the start the
Social Security Administration
has believed it has an obliga

since the development of the
computer that the task has
been reduced to manageable
proportions.
More than 18 million Amer

than nine out of 10 United

by the program. More than 75
per cent of the 65-and-over
age group are now eligible for
benefits.
Yet, the fact remains that
hundreds of thousands are pass

bargain you'll ever be offered
and one to which they are
tirely entitled because they
aren’t aware of changes in the

Home Rule Hitch
The Star’s opposition in the past to
most “home rule” bills for the District
has sprung from a real concern that
their enactment would serve to discour
age, rather than encourage, the payment
of an equitable share of the expenses of
the city by the Federal Government.
Now the President once again has sent
Congress a home rule bill which, if
adopted as proposed, would seem to
meet that objection.
This latest bill, which differs only
slightly from the administration version
proposed a year ago, contains a specific
and generally fair formula for measur
ing the size of the annual Federal pay
ment. The essential feature of the for
mula, however, as far as home rule Is
concerned, provides that these funds,
mathematically determined each year
by the formula, would be advanced auto
matically to the District of Columbia
from the United States Treasury, with
out further action by Congress. If Con
gress will commit itself to meet Its fiscal
obligation to the District through this
or some other equally acceptable pro
vision as a part of the home rule bill,
we would support the measure. Without
the Inclusion—and final enactment—of
such a binding commitment, however, we
would persist in our opposition to home
rule.
Congress has defaulted year after
year on the insufficient Federal payment
amounts which It has authorized by law.
And It makes even these inadequate
funds available only after the desperate
urgency of the need has been painfully
proved and proved again during com
mittee hearings and congressional de
bate In connection with the annual Dis
trict budget.
Our basic concern about any new
home rule bill Is that Congress will not
permit the District authorities to make
their own budgetary decisions and
then support them to the extent of the
Federal fiscal assistance which would
result from application of the proposed
formula. Without this commitment and
this support, home rule could be more
than a snare and a delusion. It could
be a disaster for this city.
Viewing America's Future
In the minds of most Americans of
middle age or beyond, the year 2000
seems a bit too remote to warrant great
concern about how the Nation’s supply
of land and other natural resources will
serve the needs of that year’s population.
But If this casual attitude Is justified
for some of the older folks, It cannot
be so for those who have every reason
to expect to be toasting the arrival of a
new century less than 37 years hence.
This Is, in fact, not very far away, and
It Is by no means too soon to give thought
to the living problems of that day.
Resources for the Future, Inc., a
nonprofit research corporation financed
by the Ford Foundation, has now re
leased the findings of a five-year study
In depth of this matter, with the en
couraging conclusion that no “general
running out of resources” in this country
is likely during the remainder of this
century or even for a long time there
after. At the same time, the research
group qualified this conclusion In sev
eral Important respects—warning that
severe temporary and regional shortages
of some resource products may develop.
Using the Census Bureau population
projection of 331 million by year 2000,
the researchers speak confidently of the
ability of available cropland to produce
all the food and fibers needed during the
next 40 years. Even so, they add, cumu
lative demands for land—for expanding
cities, highways, airfields, reservoirs, wa
tersheds, recreation space and so forth—
will be so great as to create a ""land def
icit” by the turn of the century. In this
case, they suggest “multiple use"" as one
solution.
While seeing no prospect of water
shortage on a nationwide scale, the study
did pose some problems of a regional
nature. In the East, for example, there
Is no concern about quantity but very
real concern about pollution. Increased
storage capacity and more effective
treatment of wastes are two of the rec
ommended efforts. The West, with a
much smaller normal supply, will need
not only new dams, reservoirs, long-dis
tance water transport systems, desalinl
zatlon and conservation programs, but
also what the research group calls a
SUNDAY, APRIL 7, ISS3
better allocation of water resources
among competing uses.
It Is not news, of course, that prob
lems of this nature He ahead, and It Is
not easy to say who should do what to
cope with them. All levels of govern
ment—Federal, State and local—have a
share of responsibility. So, too, does pri
vate enterprise—both In utilization of
natural resources and in a search for
suitable substitutes. The effort by all
parties must be co-operative and con
tinuing. The Ford group has been help
ful In putting together a comprehensive
discussion of things as they may be
when the 21st century arrives.
'... That Ye Be Not Judged’
Very few people will doubt that Dr.
J. Robert Oppenheimer fully merits the
highly prized Fermi Award for 1963 and
the $50,000 in cash that goes with It.
For he as much as any other man, and
perhaps more than any other man, was
responsible for the great achievement
which produced the atomic bomb, and
which, In turn, pointed the way to peace
ful uses of the atom.
One must look with some reserva
tion, however, on Intimations In the news
reports that the winning of the Fermi
Award will serve to “clear” Dr. Oppen
heimer of the findings which, almost a
decade ago, led to his exclusion from ac
cess to classified Information on the
ground that he was a security risk.
We are mindful of Matthew’s ad
monition on the hazard of judging, and
we certainly would not presume to pass
judgment on Dr. Oppenheimer. But
neither are we prepared to say that the
decision of the conscientious men who
heard the testimony pro and con In
the Oppenheimer case and who weighed
the transcript of that testimony—nearly
1,000 pages—can be reversed merely by
the presentation of the Fermi or any
other award. Os eight men who heard
the case, six, in varying degrees, were
persuaded against Dr. Oppenheimer.
All of this, however, occurred nearly
a decade ago. And It is possible that
new judges (we do not know of any new
evidence) might now decide differently
on the old record. But of Itself the
Fermi Award, although richly deserved,
clears nobody and changes nothing.
In 1954, while the Atomic Energy
Commission was debating its finding, Dr.
Oppenheimer published a little book In
which he discussed something he de
scribed as “the house called science.”
Os It, he said: “It Is a vast house Indeed
. . . there are no locks, there are no shut
doors; wherever we go there are the
signs and usually the words of welcome.
It Is an open house, open to all comers.”
This may be of some reassurance, If
Dr. Oppenheimer’s access to classified
information should be restored, to those
who go to bed at night and who wake up
In the morning worrying about spies.
The findings against Dr. Oppenheimer
did not bring his loyalty Into question.
But the Russians, with their achieve
ments in space, have shown that the
house of science of which he wrote Is
Indeed open to all.
First Responsibility
At a meeting of the Central Labor
Union Council the other night, it was
suggested that opposition of some Dis
trict School Board members to lifting
the ban on corporal punishment may
stem from a fear of providing new
ammunition to anti-lntegrationists in
the South. In reply, School Superintend
ent Hansen had this to say:
I understand what you mean. No matter
what happens in a newly integrated area,
those who are opposed to integration will say,
‘‘Now look at what It has caused.” So we
have to be careful not to Interject the ques
tion of race. . . . But we have a responsibility
to educate children who come Into our class
rooms as well as we possibly can. In order to
do this more satisfactorily than we have been
doing, we need to give teachers additional
authority. This is what the teachers tell us
themselves. What we are attempting to do
is to make our recently Integrated school
system the best possible demonstration of
integration.
What a sensible answer! And how
refreshing It Is to hear this subject
finally discussed forthrightly. For the
fact which has emerged most clearly
from the shocking allegations of the
MacCarthy Committee report, and from
all that has occurred since, is a recogni
tion that harmful and dangerous condi
tions In our schools already have been
covered up for too long, and that, smol
dering under cover, they have grown
steadily worse.
No doubt the Inadequacies recently
revealed, especially relating to discipli
nary problems, will be seized upon by
those who are out to discredit Integra
tion. And It Is quite likely that a major
reason for avoiding public discussion of
these conditions in the past was a desire
to put the brightest possible face on the
Integration experience In Washington.
But surely those people who have been
so mesmerized by this concern that they
have closed their eyes to everything else
must realize, If they think about It, that
a continuation of this kind of blindness
now cannot serve the cause of Integra
tion and will merely tend to destroy
public education In Washington.
4 Better Minuteman
A few years ago there was something
called “the missile gap” (a fiction exist
ing only in politicians’ minds), and now
we have what Is called the “Improved
Minuteman.” Even In Its original form,
this solid-fuel Intercontinental ballistic
missile was a formidable thing to think
about, but today It Is In the process of
being developed into a weapon so deadly
(four times as effective as Its current
model) that a layman’s mind can hardly
comprehend the speed and magnitude
of its destructiveness. What can be com
prehended, however, is that the field of
rocketry is subject to constant change
and advancement. This Includes such
conceivable break-throughs as a work
able antimissile missile. The “Improved
Minuteman"" is a case in point.

Plenty of Near Misses—But No Bull's-Eye
LETTERS TO THE STAR
Right to Arm
Great concern is being ex
pressed today about “civil
rights.” And rightly so. The
only way any of us can hope
to preserve our rights as free
citizens of a free republic is
to be ready and willing to de
fend them at all times against
those who would take them
from us—on the battlefield,
to protect them from armed
aggression, or through the
democratic process, to pro
tect them from our own fel
low citizens who would seek,
undoubtedly from sincere
motives, to weaken or destroy
them for the sake of admin
istrative convenience.
This is very much the case
in the current controversy
over firearms legislation.
Article II of the Bill of
Rights was placed there be
cause Its framers realized
what some of us tend, these
days, to forget; that one of
the most precious rights of a
free citizen is his right to arm
himself for lawful recreation,
for his own protection and
that of his family, and for
the defense of his home in
time of war or emergency.
This, like freedom of speech
and religion, like the right of
peaceful assembly, or like the
right of freedom from unrea
sonable search and seizure, is
one of the hallmarks of the
free man as contrasted with
the subject, who has no rights
but only privileges, granted
by the State and which the
State may limit or take away
at its own good pleasure.
If we, as the result of a
wave of artificially generated
hysteria, permit our consti
tutional right to “keep and
bear arms” to be restricted
or revoked, do we not thus
create a most dangerous prec
edent? If it is perfectly all
right to demolish the Second
Amendment because certain
law-enforcement officials feel
it would be to their conven
ience, can this not be done
for the same sort of “reason”
to any of our other rights?
Why not. for instance, put a
curb on the powerful weapon
of a free press by requiring
newspapers and magazines to
possess licenses to publish?
The press, like anything else.
Is susceptible, no doubt, to
abuses. But we don’t try to
correct these abuses by sum
marily punishing the Inno
cent. And we don’t look to
arbitrary bureaucratic meas
ures to remedy the situation.
Most Important of all, we real
ize that the press is so vital
to our free society that its
unlicensed, “unregulated” ex
istence is far preferable to
any small and questionable
“good” that might be accom
plished by putting it under
political control.
If one of our constitutional
rights can be abridged or de
stroyed at will, then we can
rest assured that, sooner or
later, so will the rest of them.

Easter Pets
With Easter coming along,
the pet stores are going to oe
selling rabbits,. chicks, and
ducks for Easter pets. Lots
of people buy these pretty
things for their children
thinking of them only as
temporary pete to be played
with and then given to the
Zoo,
What Is not recognized Is
that the Zoo does not accept
any of these Easter pets and
has not accepted any such
donations for years Neither
is it realized that chicks and
ducklings axe not durable
pets for small children. Rab
bits aren’t either, for that
matter. The mirtiandllng of
these live “toys” by small
children leads only to the
animals having broken bones
and a sad death after break
ing the child’s heart—a most
unfortunate memory of a
very unhappy Easter.
If you want to give your
child an Easter pet. please
have someone or someplace
that will accept the pet when
Momma tires of caring for
it and be sure thnt the child
is old enough to handle the
creature with care, Thus
much sadness and pain can
be avoided.

Answers Lawrence
Now honestly, who does
David Lawrence think he’s
kidding?
He draws the analogy be
tween the powers used by
the President and those of
a dictator. This is a most
subtle comparison, until one
remembers details of the
(still) democratic processes
of elections, impeachment,
etc., though perhaps Mr.
Lawrence considers these
trivial and unworthy of the
attention of the majority of
an aroused citizenry.
He comments that the
Federal Government can
only constitutionally inter
vene if “an unlawful ob
struction” has occurred, and
the State Is proved “negli
gent.” Granted the Ole Miss
situation did not occur
through negligence, but
through (at least) irrespon
sibility on the part of all
concerned, nevertheless
there was obstruction. Law
rence tacitly admits this in
ignoring the very point he
raised.
Mr. Lawrence ends his
April 1 article with one of
his favorites (as he admits,
this Is the same material he
used for the Little Rock epi
sode). He criticizes the “po
lice state” justification of
action, that the “end justi
fies the means.” I never have
been able to understand that
one. Can’t the end some
times justify the means?

Adams-Morgan
I have worked diligently
and faithfully with residents
and owners of property In
the Adams-Morgan area for
4 years in their efforts to
revitalize the community.
William Webster, presi
dent, Property Owners Pro
tective and Improvement As
sociation, states the Rede
velopment Land Agency Is
squandering the taxpayer’s
money: that some $600,000
was spent in efforts to
“brainwash” citizens into ac
cepting the proposed plan.
Perhaps Mr. Webster has
forgotten that we, some 25
block groups and area or
ganizations, asked that
Adams-Morgan be declared
an urban renewal area with
the understanding that the
best possible use would be
made of the existing land
and the least possible
amount of demolition would
take place. Mr. Webster, if
my memory serves me cor
rectly, was one of the 25
delegates to the planning
committee who voted for the
use of the powers of urban
renewal In Adams-Morgan.
Those of us who are truly
interested in the welfare of
all of the citizens of the
community did not believe
that this could be accom
plished without expenditures
for planning and surveying.
We do not believe that
money was wasted on the
professional staff which was
necessary if citizens were to
have the opportunity to work
with the National Capital
Planning Commission and the
RLA In planning the area.
Those of us who have given
of our time and energy gen
erously to the project are
grateful for the considera
tion given by the profession
als to our requests for help,
and for providing such fine
solutions to our community
problems. We are eager for
the opportunity to prove
that citizens and govern
ment, by working together,
can produce a sound and
beautiful community with
adequate facilities for our
population.

'Myopia'
Your editorial, “Myopia,”
prompts the following defini
tion:
Myopia. A benign disease
characterized by holding an
opinion different from that
held by the editors of The
Star. The condition may be
acute or chronic. The vic
tim Is also likely to be color
blind; that is, unconcerned
about the color of a person's
skin. He is also likely to be
hypersensitive about injus
tices in the American democ
racy perpetrated against all
men, women, and children,
especially those who have
known little else all their
Ilves. The incidence In the
D. C. area Is unknown, but
could be very high among
those who do not agree with
the editors of The Star.
Charles E. Walden, jr„
Vicar, St. Philip’s Episcopal
Chapel.
(Editor’s Note: Mr. Walden
misdefines and misconstrues
The Star’s editorial policy in
reference to our recent criti
cism of the board of man
agers of the D. C. Congress
of Parente and Teachers for
its myopic opposition to
School Supt. Hansen's very
sensible proposal to lift the
ban on corporal punishment
in District schools.)
Aging Pilots
In his ""On Wings” column
""Help’s on Way for ‘Little
Guy’ ” Charles Yarbrough
tells about an aviation flight
surgeon who thinks “that
the purpose of the aviation
medical physician is to keep
pilots in good condition for
flying rather than to seek
reasons to ground them.""
Some of this thinking could
rub off on the Federal Avia
tion Agency. FAA’s arbitrary
rule that indiscriminately re
moves airline pilots from
their jobs, simply because
they reach age 60, is a suit
able spot for the cogitation.

FROM THE STAR FILES...
100 Years Ago
While neither side domi
nated the field of battle at
the halfway mark of the
Civil War, the North never
theless was hitting the South
where it hurt most—in the
breadbasket. Food was be
coming alarmingly scarce in
seme sections of the Con
federacy. A bread riot oc
curred in Richmond about
this time a century ago and
on April 10. 1863, Jefferson
Davis issued a proclamation
urging his people to plant
corn, beans, peas and other
necessities. Instead of cot
ton and tobacco. The Star
of April 9, 1863, quoted from

editorially refers In ambi
guous terms to a riot which
took place In Richmond of
such magnitude as to cause
the affair to be suppressed
from publication. It appears
that the city was for a while
in control of a lawless mob
of women and men for the
ostensible purpose to save
themselves from starvation
by breaking open stores, bak
eries, etc. The movement was
headed by a female, who,
the Sentinel says, was above
want, and the whole affair
was simply to rob and plun
der, under the excuse of
scarcity of food. Millinery,
dry goods and fancy stores
suffered as much as those
containing the necessities of
life. The movement appears
to have eventuated from
high prices generally. . . .""

SPIRES OF THE SPIRIT
A Spire Above an Inn
By DR. FREDERICK BROWN HARRIS
Chaplain of lhe United State* Senate
A spire usually marks a
place dedicated to worship of
God and service to man. It
is a symbol of reverence and
of spiritual verities which
point skyward from the dust
of earth. The spires of Oxford
suggest that schools where
truth is sought and taught
can also be fittingly so
adorned.
Now, ordinarily one does
not picture a spire rising
above an inn. But recently at
a gathering of servants of
suffering humanity at the In
ternational Inn in the Na
tion’s Capital, for those with
eyes to see there arose a
spire as high as the Washing
ton Monument. That invisi
ble spire is the emblem of
the best in the life of our
America. In these hectic days
we have come to an almost
pathological emphasis on the
worst that can be catalogued
in the Nation’s record. With
our own acknowledgment of
the sorry story of rising
crime and delinquency, of
business chicanery,, hypoc
risy, and deceptive manip
ulation for selfish ends in
all walks of life, many are
tempted to put on sackcloth
and ashes and label our so
called civilization as hope
lessly corrupt. But based on
the dirty linen on the na
tional clothesline such a
verdict loses sight of the pre
ponderant proportion of
goodness in the Republic
that leavens the blasphem
ing wickedness. It closes its
eyes to the examples of self
less service to human need
everywhere that make Amer
ica the most inspiring res
ervoir of sacrificial goodwill
in all the earth. When we
sense the beneficent impact
of the United States on the
rest of the world, what we
see calls not for jeers but
for cheers!
The meeting place for an
organization of mobilized
compassion, which adds
tremendously to that impact,
was appropriately Interna
tional Inn. There it was that
those who came from far and
near heard with joyful grati
tude almost unbelievable re
ports packed with notable
exploits of MEDICO-CARE
which is but another name
for America’s outreach for
the alleviation of misery any
where in the world which is
one.
It was in 1958 that MED
ICO had breathed upon it
the breath of life by Dr.
Peter D. Comanduras who
was present and presiding at
this gathering and by the
late heroic Dr. Thomas A.
Dooley of Laos hospital
fame. Its scope is measured
by the appellation “nonsec
tarian” its uncalculating
self-denial by the term “non
profit.” As across the years
MEDICO has gone forth with
doctors, nurses and hospi
tals performing miracles of
healing, teaching and train
ing. CARE—like a modern
good Samaritan—during the
same period was distributing
almost half a billion dollars
worth of food, tools, and
medicine to more than 50
countries in Europe, Asia,
Africa, Latin America, and
the Middle East.
Then In 1962, MEDICO and
CARE merged forces. By this
wise union the cost of op
erating these vast enter
prises was reduced, duplica
tion of facilities eliminated,
and the efforts and talents
of the physicians and nurses
of MEDICO can now be
directed solely toward provid
ing the medical service for
which they are trained, while
CARE covers effectively the
task of administration.
When we realize that in
one year MEDICO treated an
estimated half million ill
people, such a colossal ac
complishment suggests why
-Ln A
“The sensational style of the
statements that came first
in relation to the reported
bread riot in Richmond
threw some doubt over the
whole story, but later partic
ulars have been received
confirming the reports and
showing a terrible state of
distress and destitution ex
isting in the Rebel capital....
The Baltimore American has
the following: ’Col. Stewart
of the 2d Indiana Cavalry,
who was confined in Libby
Prison. Richmond, arrived In
Baltimore yesterday, having
been exchanged. The colonel
confirms in all the main
points the previous accounts
of the bread riots and dis
tress in the Rebel capital.
He was himself an eye-wit
ness and could not be mis
taken. There were between
five and six hundred women
and children engaged in the
chief insurrectionary move
ment. They appeared upon
the streets in condition of
terrible distress or destitu
tion. demanding bread to
keep them from starvation
and in some instances forced
their way into stores, taking
what they could get. . . . Jeff
Davis . . . soon appeared in
the presence of the mob and
made a speech. He coun
selled forbearance upon the
part of the populace, prom
ising to render whatever was
in his power to alleviate their
suffering condition. Upon
this assurance being given,
after some time the crowd
dispersed, retiring to their
homes, but not until assured
Hate
—above International Inn
as the leaders of this com
passionate crusade met,
leaped as tall a spire as there
is in all the earth. From
under that spire nurses and
doctors are continually leav
ing the comforts and emolu
ments of service in their own
land to go to frontiers with
no physicians, to infested
jungles and humid climates
to pour themselves out, often
in primitive surroundings
with but a fraction of the
money return offered at
home.
A vital factor in this out
going of help are the very
generous gifts of the phar
maceutical industry.
Under the spire lifted in
Washington, soaring so high
as to be seen from sea to
shining sea, an international
creed was proclaimed in
these moving phrases—""We
believe that the American
physicians, nurses, and tech
nicians, living in a land of
personal freedom, economic
well being, widespread good
health, and unlimited op
portunities, recognize and
accept their obligations to
assist in the realization of
the same fundamental con
cepts for men and women
everywhere. MEDICO-CARE
is acutely aware of the obvious
fact that the world has
shrunk too much in the jet
age to allow Americans to
live in an isolated mansion
in the midst of world slums.
We believe we can ignore the
universal demand for free
dom from disease, privation,
and suffering, only at the
risk of our own humanity
and our national existence.”
Such is a modern Apostle’s
Creed for our day and age!
The outstanding American
honored by receiving this
year’s World Humanitarian
Award as the incarnation of
the spirit of MEDICO was
Walter H. Judd, M.D., of
Minnesota, the United States,
China, and the world—physi
cian, missionary, legislator,
whose decade of medicine in
China launched a lifetime of
dedication to spreading the
skill, knowledge, and tools of
healing to the darkest cor
ners of the earth. With this
deserved recognition came
the ardent hope of multi
tudes that in the years ahead
his potent voice will continue
to be heard.
But, under that spire were
also an unseen host who
make the crusade possible, a
great army of plain Ameri
cans from whose hearts and
pockets constantly pour the
gifts which speed MEDICO
CARE on its way across all
frontiers with the motto of
the healing Christ ""The
field is the World.” It was
for them, and to them, that
at the International Inn in
Washington Marian Ander
son sang, as only she can
stag it, ""He Holds the World
in His Hands.”
But, God has decreed that
Americans hold In their
hands the sinews for this
global war against starvation
and disease. You will help
answer your own prayer,
“Thy Kingdom Come,” as
you enlist your gifts under
the unfurled banners of
MEDICO-CARE!
they would be supplied with
daily rations by government
authorities. ...’**
50 Years Ago
Women fought for equal
rights on both sides of the
Atlantic 50 years ago. The
Star of April 4.1913, reported
from London that two mili
tant suffragettes had been
jailed after arrested with
bags of paraffin, oil. candles
and other combustibles with
which they were planning to
set fire to public buildings.
There were other such inci
dents in Britain, as women
resorted to violence in pro
testing the three-year sen
tence given their leader. Em
meline Pankhurst, for inciting
her followers to destroy
property. Suffragettes in
Washington were equally de
termined, but less demon
strative; one group was even
given permission to visit the
Capitol and leave petitions
with Congress asking to vote.
Representative Albert John
son, of Washington State,
went so far as to predict that
there would be a ""Congress
woman some day.”
The world s financial capi
tals were shaken 50 years
ago by the death of J. Pier
pont Morgan (the elder),
whose fortune in blue chip
securities was estimated be
tween 875 million and 8300
million. The Star of April 1,
1913. reporting Morgan's
death in Rome, said ""no
living man has held such
financial power as Mr. Mor
gan.” He was praised as a
great patron of the arts and
a philanthropist who gave
unostentatiously, but in huge
amounts. The body was be
ing returned to this country
in a ""walnut coffin, lined
with white brocade; this was
placed inside a leaden casket,
and finally in a third case

and silver fittings .. .**",sunday daily evening edition publish evening star newspaper company washington samuel kauhmann president benjamin mckelway editor main office virginia ave eurofean bureau

On The Abolition Of The State’s
Public School System
From Biloxi down on the Mississippi Gulf
Coast comes reports of a speech by the State Com
missioner of Public Welfare Monday night during
which he drew’ the conclusion that it is not un
reasonable to predict the early closing of Mississippi
Public Schols in order to prevent racial integra
tion; a conclusion folow’ed by citing a lot of figures
and facts, without mentioning the more probable
cause of such figures and facts,—calculated to be
little and condemn the Negro population of the
state, and justify and rationalize the vastly in
ferior position, under w’hich everyone know’s, Ne
groes live today in this state.
In the very first place we w’ould point out that
the reasonableness of such a prediction, and the
boldness to express such a prediction can only exist
on the part of a public official because of the denial
of the right to vote, and the denial of political par
ticipation to the Negro citizens of the state; a fact
which leads us to again say here that this state
never will emerge from the plight of its past his
tory as long as the Negro issue remains paramount
in State politics; and to say further that to elimi
nate this evil from the body politic of the state is
neither the challenge nor the responsibility of the
Negro leaders of the state, but rests with the white
leaders of the state with whom is lodged the real
powTer, influence, and authority.
In the next place we would point out that the
Negro in the Lnited States is only the instrument
in the hands of those who seek integration in the
Lnited States; on the one hand the Communist w’ho
see in the issue the confusion and interracial con
flict in this country that is serving the purpose of
world Communism; and on the other hand those
sincere white Americans of the highest positions,
who see the total abolition of racial segregation in
this country as the only w’av to successfully meet
the real challenge of World Communism to seek to
take revenge upon Negroes in Mississippi, or anv
where else in the United States, because the de
mand for the abolition of racial segregation by
law’ in this country everywhere, including Missis
sippi, becomes of increasing urgency every day, is
an attempt to place the infirmities of the strong
upon the backs of the wreak.
Moreover one sees the implication in the speech
of a wholesale desire on the part of Negroes to
abandon their owm schools to attend school with
whites, a manifestation not evident in those states
formerly with dual systems where racial segrega
tion in the schools have been removed; and even if
the reverse was the case in those states, we can see
no reason wrhy those who are willing and able
should wait for a more obvious or direct demand be
fore establishing private schools for their children,
unless it is to wait for a system that will be pri
vate in name only,,getting public support because of
the denial of the Negro right to vote, while at the
same time denying the Negro right to public educa
tion.
We would also point out here that every Ne
gro in Mississippi of one ounce of intelligence,
along with every intelligent white person, in Mis
sissippi, and everywhere else, knows that all those
figures about Negro illegitmacy, Negro veneral di
seases, the large number of Negroes receiving pub
lic welfare, and etc. are the result of a political
and economic system that makes it possible to bring
into the state a factory that employs 300 white peo
ple and not a single Negro, and are not examples
of inherent racial inferiority.
We Mississippians had better start learning to
discuss our race relations problems without refer
ring to all of the rest of the Black, Brown, and Yel
low people in the world,, which includes China, In
dia, Japan, and Africa, because no matter how we
are moved by the nostalgia of the past, neither
Mississippi, nor the United States itself has the
power to turn back the current of history.
We see no need for us Negro citizens of Mis
sissippi to be too much disturbed or offended by the
State Commisvsioner of Public Welfares Speech,
because in our opinion it could well be the fore
runner of real and sincere effort on the part of the
responsible white leaders of the state to take the
leadership in seeing that Negro citizens of the
state get the right to vote and political participa
tion.

Kennard Recuperating From
Operation Plans Return To State
CHICAGO.—(ANP)— Clyde
A. Kennard, 35-year-old Army
veteran whose attempts to en
roll at the University of South
ern Mississippi two years ago
touched off a chain reaction a
gainst him which landed him
in jail and in debt of more than
$10,000, is planning to return to
his hometown of Hattiesburg,
Miss., next month.
Kennard, currently is recup
erating from an operation at
the home of a sister, Mrs.
Sarah Tarpley. He was flown
to Chicago by comedian Dick
Gregory for an operation to re
move a malignancy in his intes
tines at Billings hospital on the
University of Chicago campus.
After thrice being refused ad
mission to the Mississippi
school, Kennard was subse
quently arrested on charges of
stealing $25 in chicken feed,
and sentenced to seven years
in prison. Last January, he
was released on order of Gov.
Ross Barnett when it was dis
closed he was dying of cancer.
Hospital reports at that time
indicated that unless he re

he would not live more than

tion from the vacation White
House.
CONFLICT CITED
‘ Since October 1962."" the report
said, ""the open and flagrant vio
lation of constitutional guarantees
in Mississippi has precipitated se
rious conflict which, on several
occasions, has reached the point
of crisis. . . Each week brings
fresh evidence of the danger of
a complete breakdown of law and
order.”
The report cited a long list of
incidents and said that despite
j vigorous action by federal author
ities. ""the nation must be con
cerned that the pattern of unlaw
ful activity shows no sign of abat
ing.”
In the fiscal year ended June
30. 1962, the commission said, the
federal government poured some
$650 million in aid to various
agencies of the state, including
military contracts and payrolls,
while it received only $270 million
from all tax sources in the state.
“Massive assistance to the
economy of Mississippi has con
tinued past the time when the
state placed itself in direct de
fiance of the Constitution and fed
eral court orders,” the commis
sion said.
FOR EXAMPLE
“For example, the National
Aeronautics and Space Agency is !
proceeding with plans to build a ,
$400-million moon-rocket engine
test center in Pearl River and
Hancock Counties. Mississippi,” it
added.
The report said the Federal Avi
ation Agency also had just grant
ed $2.18 million for construction
of a jet airport in Jackson, “with
j out questioning the airport's plan
! to build separate eating and rest
I room facilities.”
The commission urged the Pres
ident:
1. To reiterate his concern over
the Mississippi situation and call
on all persons in the state to
j ""join in protecting the rights of
U.S. citizens.”
2. To ""continue and strengthen
| his administration’s efforts to sup
press existing lawlessness and
provide federal protection to citi

YWCA News
April 21-28, 1963
It’s National YWCA Week
again.
Each year at this time the
members and friends of YWCAs
in large and small communities,
j both urban and rural and on col
lege campuses, celebrate Na
| tional YWCA Week. This year
the observances will focus on
* the theme, “The YWCA—Where
You Can Belong.’’
In a rapidly changing and in
creasingly uncertain world this
theme, which is emphasized and
illustrated by the year-round
I services of the YWCA to the
I people of our community is par
ticularly apt. It is good to be
long, to know you belong to a
group—a place, an organization
as friendly, steadfast and dedi
cated as the YWCA.
For a number of 17 V2 years
our city has had a YWCA serv
ing the community. Many of
us take it for granted. We j
think of it as a place where
women and girls can find decent
housing, perhaps a good cafe
teria; friends, clubs, classes.
It is more than these that
make the YWCA a place where j
one can belong—more than a
sewing class, ceramic, music or
a hat class or bridge games.
It is its faith in and concern
for people which make the
YWCA what it is.
The YWCA is a membership
organization which believes in
and works with people, all peo
ple, as members of the human
family. Its doors and program
are open to all in Christian fel- i
lowship, regardless of race,
creed or class.
Each member is given an op
portunity to get and to give.
Each can receive personal devel
opment and growth and give to •
ethers through cooperation,
fellowship and services to the
community and the world by
belonging in a group working
to help make our community
and our world a better place.
It is good to know that the
YWCA and its services belong
to the community, and that we.
the community, through support
and participation, belong to it.
This National YWCA Week,
lot us all take a new, apprecia
tive look at a valued asset in
our midst—“The YWCA, Where
You Can Belong.”

Social Security
Query Told
This information on Social
Security is prepared by John
F Pate. Jackson District
Manager for Social Security.
QUESTION: I employ seven or
eight people during the summer.
Last summer one of the men did
not have his social security card
so I listed his name' on the social
security report without a num
ber. Last week I got a letter from
the Social Security Administra- j
tion in Baltimore asking for his I
social security number. I think ,
I can get it but is it important? |
I only paid the man $65.
ANSWER: It is important and |
you should make every effort to
get the account number and re
port it to the Social Security Ad
ministration. This particular
worker, for example, may need
that quarter of social security
coverage to qualify for benefits.
Generally, a quarter of coverage
is one in which a wage earner
is paid $50 or more. The $65 you
paid, but which has not yet been
credited to his account, could
make quite a difference. If you
cannot get the social security
number, you should furnish his
last known address.
(If you have questions on so
cial security, write, visit, or call
the social security office at 502
North Street, Jackson, Missis
sippi. Not all questions can be
answered in this column. Please
give your name and address in
letters to be sure of a personal
reply. Names and addresses are
never used in this oolumnU
on Wednesday, April 24.

FARISH
STREET
By JAMES RUNDLES
IF YOU WERE OUT AT ALL
EASTER SUNDAY ... You
couldn’t help but notice how
good the sisters and brothers of
color were looking in their East
er finery as they headed for
church and other places, and I
know you also paid attention to
the fact that the children were
looking mighty nice too, all of
which brings us around to some
thing me and the boys were dis
cussing in our favorite quiet
corner in a little spot on the
northern end of Farish street
just the other night.
To tell the truth we started
off talking about baseball, then
a rather fine looking young
lady walked in and changed the
whole subject. Everybody a
round the table ii mediately a
greed that the young lady was
handsomely endowed with all the
physical attributes that could
turn heads and inspire dreams of
varied adventures, but one of
the boys brought up something
that was really worth remem
bering and repeating in the good
ole avenue journal.
He was saying to us that the
ladies blessed with the built-in
TAN had really come a long
way over the past five or six
years in bringing out the nat
ural beauty, gTace and charm,
with which they had been endow
ed from the days of the Queen
of Sheba down to Lena Horne
and Leslie Uggams. This fel
j low went on to say that the
here is little “ole” New York
and the interesting thing about
this venture is that one of our
very fine Negro writers and a
person of many talents is vice
president of Afro Asian Im-1
ports our Lorenzo D. Parker
who writes under the pen name '
of June L’Rhue . . . Together 1
they proudly display exquisite1
sari Cloths and hand-loomed |
pure silks from New Delhi as
well as wood carvings from
Africa and copperware from
Egypt ... So, all hail to the
Mr. Rajimer Singh whose New
Delhi neighbor somehow read;
our ‘Global Portraits.”
When we think of those
whose business ventures flou
rish whether in New Delhi, Af
rica, Jamaica, or here in USA
we proudly wave our “Global
Portrait' banner today for the

Conference

JOSEPH F. ALBRIGHT
A newly accepted member of
a private club was proving to be
a very popular addition to the
exclusive group. He was ac
cepted with unquestioned cor
diality by just about everyone
in the organization with the ex
ception of one stubborn member
who steadfastedly avoided him.
Pressed for a reason as to why
he persisted in his unfriendly
attitude toward the popular new
comer, he tersely stated, “I am
determined not to like him, but
I can’t hold out if I permit any
personal association.”
There is a moral imbedded in
his story that is far more dang
erous than amusing. We who
propose to make Mississippi our
permanent home will do well to
heed its significance.
Scarcely a day passes but that
I do not hear some earnest ex
pression from a friend, associate,
or acquaintance deploring the
stresses and strains that the
current tide of disruptive events
is placing upon the lines of com
munication between the racial
groups in the State. Most of this
comment is obviously sincere,
stemming from those who are
in basic agreement upon one be
lief: If every possible effort is
not made and sustained to keep
the lines of traditional friendly
communication open, then we
could be inviting incalculable
harm to us all.
Time has ever been the ally
of those who walk the road of
sincerity with a vigorous bene
ficient determination. And, in-1
versely, it has been truthfully'
said that the road to hell is pav-!
ed with good intentions.
In this day, when we are con
stantly plagued with intemper
ate words and action, calculated
disruption, and just about every
conceivable form of sociological i
stupidity ... we of good faith
and loyal concern for the wel
fare of our great State had
better come up with something j
besides questionable “good in
tentions”. You can believe me
when I say that there are no
miracles in the offing.
supernatural devises, that is ... i
flashing eyes and the tantaliz
ing grace and structure of the
Ebony-hues lasses had re-writ

compliment with the proper sur
roundings and the necessary coin
of the realm that enabled them
to relax and be beautiful in pre
ference to breeding wrinkles in
their faces worrying about
where their next meal or dress
was coming from.
This gentleman who had the
floor, so to speak, in our little
Farish street hidaway that eve
ning, proceeded to indulge in
the opinion that the brothers of
the brown group were in line
for a few compliments too. Ac
cording to him, the brothers are
beginning to wake up to the fact
that they’re supposed to provide
the necessary ammunition (mon
ey) for the ladies to use to
make themselves look pretty. He
even used some strong words
and said that women ain’t sup
posed to have to worry about
nothing . . . that we men are
supposed to do all the providing
and they’re just supposed to look
pretty and be there when called
upon for the little things that
add to happiness in a home.
Well . ... .1 don’t know if
everything that good brother
said was exactly true . . . but I
do know that the sisters were
looking like something good on
Easter Sunday . . . and you bet
ter believe it.

TALKING ABOUT SOME
THING FUNNY.That
Colored brother who accidentlv
knocked a policeman down while
the officer was directing traffic
at a busy intersection. The ex
cited brother, who was a big
fellow, leaped from his car
apologising and bodily picked
the officer off the ground hold
ing him suspended in the air
while brushing off his uniform
. . . ’ The policeman, who was
almost too mad to talk, looked
up and shouted “Boy if you don’t
put me down I’ll throw you in
jail.”

work groups.
The Senate wrote a mild
anti-discrimination amendment
into President Kennedy’s Youth
Employment bill Wednesday, a
move sponsors had tried to
avoid for fear of losing the
southern vote.
Tlie amendment, offered by Sen.
John G.* Tower. R-Tex., an oppo
nent of the measure, was lifted
from the bill that created the Civ
ilian Conservation Coim of the
1930's. It provides that enrollees
be selected without regard to race
or color and says nothing about
segregation.
i A second amendment offered by
I Tower, requiring that the campi
be lacially integrated and that no
discrimination be practiced in the
use of any facilities involved In
the program was killed.
The same fate <was dealt a third
; amendment by Tower to cut off
ledcral aid td any local government
practicing discrimination in any
i form where home - town youth en
rollees were employed.
naf?e V°te f^r the anti - discrimi
nation amendment was 71 to 15 am
opposed were southern Democrats
Hmnnl Den?ocratic WhiP Hubei t
Humphrey, who earlier had warned
of a possible southern filibuster if
ouch a rider were Included, accept
ed the proposal and it passed b”
an -overwhelming vote. *
Republican opponents of the bill
had said earlier they would nor
Otter an anti - d^rimioatiaa rider
because of assurances by Attv. Gen
Robert F. Kennedy that the pro
31 am would be administered with
out regard to race.
Sen. Jacob jaylts, N. Y.. one of
the few Republicans supporting th*>
bill, said he favored striking ou*
the YOC on grounds that it would
cost too much for what it pro
duces.
Sen. A. Willis Robertson. D
Va.. said the administration would
pick up several votes for the mea
sure if the YCC feature were tak
en out.
The bill would set up a YCC
similar to the Civilian Conserva
tion corps of the 1930's 10 work
in forests and parks, employing
15.000 young men the first year
and provide up to 75 per cent of
the cost lor community work
groups to employ 50.C00 boys and
girls in parks, libraries and other
public facilities
Congress would uecide alter die
first year whether to continue or
abandon the program. It calls for
first .. year authorization of S100
million!
""The bill survived its first test
Thursday when the Senate refused
to send it b.ick to the committee.
lathering to bust out and resolve
our “problems”. No, indeed.
What then, one might inquire
with becoming anxiety after all
of the foregoing, what do we
do NOW?
My answer to that is very
simple: We talk. Oversimpli
fication? I do not believe so, so
I repeat — we TALK with each
other, and we KEEP talking
with open minds and under
standing. In such a time of in
terracial crisis as confronts us,
reluctance to mediate can breed
skepticism . . . which breeds
grave doubt . . . which breeds
mistrust . . . which can breed
anything destructive.
Why are we not engaging in
more and more frank, objective
discussion between the respon
sible and respected members of
both races in Mississippi? Not
long ago business groups of both
races passed splendid resolu
tions, in which were included
unequivocal statements against
any and all forms of racial vio
lence. Excellent! was the com
ment heard on all sides; but
what has been the sequel to
such a fine co-gesture? Surely,
in God’s name, we have not
reached an impasse wherein we
have become so downright scar
ed of being identified with the
forces of agitation because of an
act of racial cooperation that
we would timidly refrai, from
doing just that? For if we
have, then we will be sitting
ducks for the kiss of death from
those very forces. They could
hope for nothing better.
Let us Mississippians counsel
together more and more to
strengthen the sinews of the
State. And for the timid, let
me assure them that such a
course of constructive action is
as far removed from “integra
tion” as the limits of Outer
Space.

300 Diners Fete Wheatley,
Foes Outside Rap Leader
State Senator H, Winship
Wheatley, Democrat of Prince
Georges, attempted to soothe
intra-party friction last night
at a testimonial dinner in his
honor.
As Maryland Gov. Tawes,
top members of the state Dem
cratlc team and more than 300
guests toasted the Senate Dem
ocratic leader, however, a cara
van of light cars and a hearse
circled the Prince Georges Mo-
I tor Hotel, site of the affair.
The cars, bore signs alluding
to the alleged loss of important
local bills in the State Senate
during the recent session of
the General Assembly.
Leader of the caravan was
Julian C. Holmes, a member
of the committee seeking to ob
tain home-rule powers from
Prince Georges under a char
ter form of government. Mr.
Holmes said, however, that the
caravan was not sponsored by
the committee.
The signs included one stat
ing: “Expansion of the County
Board Killed by Wheatley,”
and another “Park and Plan
ning Slain.”
The first referred to a bill,
sponsored by the county’s 10-
man delegation in the House
to increase the Board of County
| Commissioners from 5 to 7
which was not acted on in the
Senate. The second sign re
ferred to an amendment tacked
on in the Senate—with con
currence of the majority of
House members, which stripped
the Maryland National Park
and Planning Commission of
some of its power to originate
and prepare master plans.
It was this sort of rivalry be
tween the delegation and him
self that Senator Wheatley re
ferred to when he said: “My
colleagues in the delegation are
working hard to put over a
program, but there are dif
ferences of opinion. But this
is no reason to split the party
or our government.”
Gov. Tawes led the preaise
for Senator Wheatley, who has
been an elected official in

Chairman McClellan an
nounced yesterday that th<
congressional probe into aware
of the contract for the TFS
warplane will resume Wednes
day by the Senate Permanent
Investigations Subcommittee.
The group began closed
hearings in February but testi
mony had been suspended sinct
April 10. It is trying to deter
mine whether favoritism or er
rors were involved in the con
tract eventually expected tc
involve expendituees of $6 tc
$7 billion.
Senator McClellan said name
of the witnesses would be an
nounced early this week.
Secretary of Defense McNa
mara testified Wednesday be
fore a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee that the TFX
'tactical fighter experimental)
will be the finest military air
craft in the world.
Testifying on a $49 billion
defense spending program fox
the next fiscal year, Mr. Mc-
Namara said the contract may
total as much as $7 billion
if 1,700 of the speedy Jet air
craft are bought for use by
the Navy and Air Force.

H. Winship Wheatley of Prince Georges,
Democratic majority leader of the State Sen
ate, chats with Maryland Gov. Tawes (right)
shortly before a dinner marking the senator's
25 years in public life.—Star Staff Photo.
Prince Georges—except for a
period of wartime service—for
25 years.
“This last session of the legis
lature,” the governor said,j
""handled more than 2,000 bills
and more controversial items
than any other legislature in
the past 25 years.”
He praised Senator Wheat
ley’s ability as the adminis-!
tration’s leader in the Senate
and for ""his dedication to the
people of Prince Georges
County.”
The senator, however, did not
lash out at critics among the
House delegation and in civic
organizations who claimed Ik
used his position to kill local
measures. The senator had re
peatedly said he would answer
these critics at the testimonial
dinner.
Immediately following th*
legislative session, several
House members said the Sena

Constitution Amending Process
Press Conference Comments on Issue
By President Kennedy Are Criticized
Impromptu statements by
a President of the United
States at a news conference
can evoke widespread criti
cism, especially if the an
swers show that they have
not been thought through.
Thus, President Kennedy
over Nation-wide television
and radio networks told a
large section of the Ameri
can people on Wednesday
that, in effect, there is some
thing wrong in trying to
amend the Constitution of
the United States. Yet that
document itself prescribes
the methods of amendment,
and the fact is that the Con
stitution has oeen amended
22 times since the founding
of the Republic.
Mr. Kennedy has a right to
oppose particular amend
ments that he doesn’t like.
But he will be regarded as
out of bounds when he de
clares that people who rant
to amend the Constitution
are not “defending” the Con
stitution, particularly when
their purpose in the instance
referred to is to secure the
adoption of specific amend
ments that will preserve and
defend the basic orinctples
of the Constitution itself
against usurpation and abuse
of power.
The President’s words, as
they appear in the White
House transcript of Wednes
day's news conference, were
as follows:
“It has always seemed to
me remarkable that those
people and organizations who
are founded In order to de
fend the Constitution should
seek to change it, and par
ticularly to change it in such
a basic way, either to affect
the power of the Congress to
amend the Constitution and
put severe limitations upon
the Congress—which, after
all. represents the people
most directly—or otherwise
to affect the power of the
Supreme Court, which is one
of the most important pro
tections of individual rights
and one of the most impor
tant securities we have for
an amicable settlement of
disputes, and which, after
all, became such a signifi
cant part of our American
constitutional development
under the leadership of an
American who is usually
heralded—Mr. John Mar-
DORIS FLEESON
Some Didn't Come to Dinner
G. 0. P. Absentees Were Conspicuous
At Affair for Senator Goldwater
The men who didn’t come
to dinner tended to monopo
1i z e political speculation
when Republicans gathered
here to honor Senator Gold
water at SI,OOO a plate. Oov.
Rockefeller chose to honey
moon, former President Eis
enhower to play golf at Au
gusta, Richard Nixon was
moving to New York, Gov.
Scranton said he was busy
at Harrisburg with his
legislature.
This left the honoree and
Gov. Romney of Michigan in
somewhat solitary splendor.
It was therefore decided
there would be no dais, no
formal seating. Guests got
an hour for cocktail min
gling and could then seat
themselves as they pleased.
This dangerous freedom,
which would never do for
Democrats, brought some
complaints but had this ad
vantage: The paying cus
tomers were left free to en
joy their real hero, Senator
Goldwater, who is about the
only detached analyst of his
presidential chances within
his circle.
How long that detachment
can last is questionable. Ex
perience suggests that poli
ticians, soon or late and
mostly soon, believe their
Peking Plays for Time
By BERNARD GWERTZMAN
Star Start Writer
Behind the Red Chinese re
quest for a month's delay In
their ideological talks with the
Russians apparently lies the
hope that Premier Khru
shchev’s policies will be upset
by the time of the meeting.
The May 28 Central Com
mittee meeting of the Soviet
Communist Party now takes
on even greater Importance as
a crucial test for Mr. Khru
shchev and his supporters.
Mr. Khrushchev is not be
lieved in danger of being
toppled from power by the
party hierarchy. But there
probably are several members
of the Central Committee who
prefer a more conciliatory atti
tude toward the Chinese who
will exert pressure on Mr.
Khrushchev to make a mean
ingful compromise with the
Chinese Communist Party.
Russian Reply Delayed
The Russians have not yet
replied to yesterday's note from
Peking which accepted Moscow
as the place top the peace talks,
but asked for a month's post
ponement from May 15 to mid-
June.
Moscow is expected to agree
to the June date. Chinese
leader Mao Tse-tung’s agree
ment on Moscow as the site of
the talks was a concession to
the Russians, since Mr. Mao
had first suggested Peking as
a meeting place two months
ago.
In coming weeks, experts
expect the Chinese leaders to
shall. So I would think that
the efforts will come to noth
ing, and I will be glad when
they do not.”
But Mr. Kennedy failed to
tell his audience that the
current movement to amend
certain parts of the Con
stitution has grown out of
the controversy over who
should apportion the voting
districts in a State and other
instances of alleged usurpa
tion of power by the Su
preme Court—which has no
right to amend the Consti
tution. The proper methods
at present for making
changes in the Constitution
are specified in the docu
ment, itself.
Mr. Kennedy apparently
hasn’t looked into the pro
posals which have been made
recently by various organiza
tions of citizens and which
already have received the
support of several State leg
islatures.
First of all. it is im
portant to emphasize some
thing which the general pub
lic may not realize and which
perhaps high officials in our
Government have brushed
aside namely, that the
Constitution can be amended
in other ways than by a two
thirds vote of both Houses
of Congress and ratification
by three-fourths of the State
legislatures. It can be done
directly by the people.
For Article V of the
Constitution provides that
Congress, “on the application
of the legislatures of two
thirds of the several States,
shall call a convention for
proposing amendments,
which, in either case, shall be

Congress.”
It so happens that the fa
mous Prohibition Amend
ment was repealed and
the Twenty-first Amendment
substituting for it was adopt
ed without being submitted
to the legislatures of the
States. It was ratified instead
by conventions in two-thirds
of the States summoned by
the State legislatures. It took
only nine months to accom-

A serious and potentially di
visive Goldwater candidacy
seems inevitable unless and
until Republicans soon find
a number of broad channels
through which to funnel
their obvious vigor and con
fidence. As the showdowns
approach, G. O. P. emphasis
is still on the negative, both
as to issues and people.
The most extraordinary as
pect of their conversations is
their omission of even a pass
ing glance at their qualified
Senators, except for the spe
cial case of Senator Gold
water. The contrast to the
Democrats during the similar
period prior to their 1960 tri
umph is striking.
The Senate then had a vir
tual monoply of the party's
presidential aspirants, and
every Democrat had a place
to go. Majority Leader John
son was the white hope of
conservatives, Senator Hum

Symington was taking a mid

plish ratification by the con
vention method, and estab

ification.
The present movement—
which Mr. Kennedy calls, in
effect, an attack on the Con
stitution—is sponsoring three
amendments. The first would
clarify the language of Arti
cle V and simplify the proce
dure so that, whenever two
thirds of the State legisla
tures submitted identical
texts of a particular amend
ment to be voted on and it
was then approved by three
fourths of the State legisla
tures, the amendment would
be automatically certified as
having been adopted.
The second amendment
proposed would preclude
Federal consideration of
matters relating to reappor
tionment of State legisla
tures.
The third proposes the
creation of a ""Court of the
Union” which would have
the final say in matters of
confuting State - Federal
claims of power under the
Constitution.
These three amendments
would, of course, be valid
only if adopted under either
of the two existing methods
now prescribed in the Con
stitution. A dozen State leg
islatures already have ap
proved the first amendment,
another dozen the second
and three the third.
The National. Council of
State Governments com
posed of official representa
tives of each State in the
Union—adopted a resolution
last year proposing the three
amendments described above.
The council said that there
had been a strong shift to
with the extension of Fed
eral powers and that various
Federal court decisions
""carry a strong bias on the
Federal side.”
Here, therefore, is a cred
itable movement by citizens
who are proceeding in a con
stitutional manner. Yet Mr.
Kennedy, with a sweeping
denunciation that reveals he
hasn’t really studied the
problem, puts the presiden
tial finger of discredit on
them as somehow having an
improper attitude toward
amending the Constitution,
even though the method they
are using to make the
change is specifically pre
scribed in the Constitution

JOSEPH KRAFT
Professors 1 ""Boycott' of Space
Top Experts Not Identified With Drive
Missing Chance to Boost Science
When this country first
awoke to the challenge of
sputnik, it was confidently
asserted that the American
intellectual was at last com
ing into his own. But, in
fact, the space program has
become a fief for the rotari
ans of this world while the
most distinguished members
of the scientific community
are indifferent if not hostile
—a state of affairs apt to do
harm both to the program
and the scientific community.
The rotarian character of
the program is depressingly
obvious. Its public purpose
is crude—victory in a race to
the moon. Its chief political
backers have been famous
wheeler-dealers Lyndon
Johnson and the late Senator
Robert 8. Kerr. It is run by
managerial types oriented
toward the areospace indus
try. Its face is the ballyhoo
section of the Luce publica
tions; its voice, the soporific
homilies of Col. Glenn.
No less obvious is the dis
tance taken by the scientific
establishment. Os the 30 or
40 distinguished men who hold
the prize professorships at
Harvard. Yale, Columbia,
Princeton, Chicago and Cali
fornia. not one is identified
with—much less actively en
gaged in—the space program.
In private, many have voiced
sharp criticisms of the pro
gram—notably, the man on
the moon, or Apollo, project.
Their views have been echoed
by the most thoughtful and
sensistive members of the
press and the Congress. Sen
ator Fulbright, for example,
in the Clayton lectures last
THE EVENING STAR
WsiAingten, D. C., friday, May 10, 1903
week, asked whether space
exploration ""is a more impor
tant and pressing national
need than other needs such
as employment and education
and urban renewal.”
No doubt the scientific es
tablishment has its reasons
for standing aloof. It has
come to grief in the past
when it lent prestige to men
more keen for power than
truth. It has been systemati
cally bypassed by the space
agency on major decisions as
to the purpose, pace and de
sign of the program. On one
important recent decision, in
fact, NASA would not even
wait for the results of a study
by the President’s Scientific
Adviser. ♦
But the way to alter the
balance in the space pro
gram is not to stand outside
and snipe. The Nation is
committed, and it will not be
much moved by generalized
charges likening the pro
gram to an exercise in ""leaf
raking."" What can be altered
is the relative emphasis on
projects within the program.
But that can only be ac
complished through detailed
1 comment by thoughtful sci
entists who have become
versed in the program through
work on the Inside. With
out such statements, indeed,
the public has no standard
for gauging the program ex
l cept the standard of reach
ing the moon. Only those
i on the bandwagon, in other
words, can shape its course,
I and Indicate other directions
it might be taking.
Participation by the scien
tific establishment, more
over, can do more than im
prove the present quality of
A-9
the program. It can decisive
ly affect the enduring char
acter of the space effort.
For whether this country
reaches the moon first, as
seems increasingly possible,
or whether Russia takes the
cigar, the winning of the race
will spell the end of the
present justification for the
space program. The oppor
tunity to go beyond the moon
will beckon, and the door will
be open to a new and more
sensible rationale—a ration
ale that might include as one
of its important components,
the pursuit of knowledge for
its own sake. The more so, as
the handful of first-rate
young scientists who are in
the program report that
space study affords unique
clues to some of the classic
humanistic problems that
have always intrigued the
most serious men of science:
Problems such as the origin
of life, for example, or of the
solar system.
To be sure there is some
thing seedy about using the
space program as a cover
for serious scientific inquiry.
Still the atmosphere of the
affluent society offers only
rare openings to direct public
energies and resources to
purposes that are not vain.
For the most eminent scien
tists to overlook the power
ful grip of space on the pub
lic imagination would be to
forego an almost unique op
portunity for the advance
ment of science. Which of
them would have forgiven

Interpreting the Law on Sit-Ins
Recent Supreme Court Decisions
Viewed as Not Clarifying the Issue
Who knows what the ""law
of the land” is with respect
to Negro demonstrations and
resultant disorders in Bir
mingham. Ala., and other
cities throughout the coun
try?
Are State or city police
forbidden to arrest anyone
for inciting disorder as long
as the purpose or objective
is to demonstrate for a law
ful cause?
These questions are touched
upon in one way or another
in a series of decisions of the
Supreme Court of the United
States which were handed
down this week. But the
opinions rendered do not
clarify the issue. In most of
the decisions, technicalities
are intermingled with con
stitutional principle, and it
is difficult to know where
one begins and the other
ends.
Thus, the Supreme Court
decided that in one city,
which has an ordinance for
bidding integration, it was
lawful for sit-in demonstra
tors to demand service along
side of whites in restaurants.
The decision said, in effect,
that the proprietor was or
dered by State law and didn’t
segregate lunch counters of
his own free will.
In another city, where
there was no State or city
law requiring segregation, the
Supreme Court held that
statements made from time
to time by public officials
amounted to the same thing
as a law. Hence, demon
strators were within their
rights in pursuing their ob
jectives and the restaurant
owner was being ""coerced”
by city officials and was not
acting of his own accord in
maintaining segregated lunch
counters.
These confusing interpre
tations were by no means
unanimous. Justice Harlan,
one of the most learned of
the members of the court.

Negro Struggle Has Dual Aspect
Showdown Foreseen in Own Ranks
Between Militants and Extremists
The struggle of the Ameri
can Negro for full citizen
ship—a true people’s revolu
tion—is a dual struggle. Con
tained within the obvious
black versus white showdown
in the South is the black ver
sus black showdown within
Negro ranks.
After 50 years the Negro
intramural contest is no
longer one between the
' accommodationist” strategy
school of which Booker T
Washington was the mentor,
and the “militancy” school,
led by the NAACP. The con
test is now between the mili
tancy school and the extrem
ist school, now most loudly
represented by the ""Black
Muslims.”
The militancy of the
NAACP. whose work in Bir
mingham before the mass
rioting began was in the di
rect line of the position taken
at its founding meeting in
1909 “absolute refusal to
differentiate the rights of
human beings""—has never
been intended to mean vio
lence. while recognizing that
violence might occur. It was
Intended to mean force. In
terpreted as the force of

CHARLES BARTLETT
New Hopes for U. S. Architecture
GSA Design Chief May Reverse
'Sterility' of Public Buildings Here
Benjamin Disraeli once
observed that no professional
group had really done its
duty until it was obliged to
furnish up a victim. ""Sup
pose an architect were
hanged."" he said ""Terror
has its inspiration as well as
competition.""
Although it has not
reached the hanging stage,
public resentment is rising
at the aspect of some of the
public buildings for which
this generation must pay and
with which future genera
tions must live.
Certainly in Washington
the vast and sterile State
Department building, the
pompous new Senate Office
Building and the still un
finished. increasingly incred
ible House Office Building
are examples of the scars that
can be inflicted upon a beau
tiful Capitol by a casual use
of taste at the drawing
board.
The issue was raised re
cently in New York by the
report of a panel of archi
tects and architectural crit
ics that a survey of the civic
patterns constructed since
1958 had revealed a pattern
of ""deadly mediocrity."" The
survey concluded that the
city government had not built
any structure of generally
recognised excellence since
1803
Henry Mencken wrote 30
years ago that no one had
ever lost money underesti
mating the taste of the Am
erican public. But taste is
spreading like other luxuries
to the masses, and the past
era of indifference is under
attack. Mrs. Kennedy has
rescued the White House
from tastelessness, and the
President views the blue
prints of structures to be
built under his authority with
took issue with the other jus
tices on the extent to which
private rights may be in
vaded.
Most significant is the
court’s view that when a
demonstration leads to vio
lence and disorder, the dem
onstrators are not held to be
at fault. Chief Justice War
ren said, with regard to dne
of the cases, that incitement
to disorder may occur, but
that those whose acts gave
rise to the riots or disorders
could not be punished. He
said:
""But it is sufficient to say
again that a generally
worded statute, when con
strued to punish conduct
which cannot be constitu
tionally punished, is uncon
stitutionally vague.
""And the possibility of dis
order by others cannot justi
fy exclusion of persons from
a place if they otherwise have
a constitutional right
founded upon the equal pro
tection clause—to be pres
ent.”
The mere fact that the
police felt that demonstra
tions and riots might ensue
was not sufficient ground for
the police to arrest those who
refused to obey their orders.
Incidentally, the court’s
comment that the law can
not intervene until an ac
tual disorder takes place is
interesting in view of the re
cent action of the President
of the United States in or
dering troops to Alabama on
the theory that there might
be disorders. The power he
claimed to send troops was
based upon a threatened out
break of violence. According
to the new Supreme Court
opinion, he presumably
should not have issued such
orders to mobilize troops
until violence actually had
occurred.
This week’s Supreme Court
decision makes it plfcin that
Negroes who were playing
aims have always been lim
ited to those simple human
rights common to the rest of
us and shared within our
common society.
The Black Muslims preach
hatred of the whites as a
race, which is a negation of
i the democratic principle of
, the individuality of guilt, and
total, geographical separa
tism, which is a practical
impossibility.
Por some years now. the
, old- line accommodationists

willing to work their way
through self - improvement.

and the strategy concept and
staff of the NAACP have

i South: now they will appear
i to everyone as the moderates.
What they have been try
■ Ing to do. in a phrase, is
simply to undo the undoing
t of the Emancipation Procla-
i mation and the Thirteenth.
Fourteenth and Fifteenth
f Amendments, the undoing
1 that was accomplished by an
r intricate series of laws and
) regulations in the South dur-
a cold and critical eye. Aes
thetic forces are mobilizing
to make the public sensitive
on issues of taste.
But it is not easy to im
pose taste upon the public
domain, particularly in an
area where it has long been
penetrated by grasping polit
ical fingers. In the case of
almost any ugly structure
that has been built by the
national. State or local gov
ernments, the odds are heavy
that the architect was se
lected. in a process of isilit
ical favor, because he was
somebody’s friend or because
he contributed to somebody’s
campaign.
The process is sometimes
more v«i U Some possessors
of the po tr to influence the
award of architectural con
tracts ha, i agents visit hack
firms an*( offer to secure
public dee gn Jobs in return
for a kick »ck of part of the
fee. Such deals are appeal
ing to th» hacks, who would
not other* w be favored, and
relatively simple for the polit
ical rascal the fees are
fixed; no competitive bids
are involved, and the public
has proved unlikely to pro
test the final product.
The public has tacitly ac
cepted the selection of ar
chitects for public buildings
by political preference. The
architects themselves have
been slow to organize as a
profession and extremely
slow to protest this modus
operand). The good ones
have been busy doing Jobs
which they secured through
talent, and the mediocre ones
have been vying for the
fruits by applying political
pressure In inverse ratio to
their talents. The reach of
this pressure is suggested by
the fact that the most hand-
basketball in a public park
and who were themselves
peaceable could not be legal
ly arrested, and that the im
pact of the incident on those
who opposed the use of pub
lic facilities by Negroes is not
relevant.
In the South Carolina case,
where the manager of a store
refused to serve his Negro
customers except at separate
tables, the court held that,
since the city ordinance re
quiring segregation was not
constitutional, any act based
upon it by an individual was
also invalid.
In the Louisiana case,
where there was no law re
quiring segregation, the Su
preme Court took cognizance
of the absence of such a stat
ute. It ruled, however, that,
because city officials had
publicly denounced ""sit-ins”
and because the store man
agers conferred with those
officials and the police when
a demonstration in the store
took place, they were guilty
of collaboration with city au
thorities. It was declared by
the court that, in effect, the
store was operating at the
dictate of city officials.
The manager of the de
partment store in question
declared that he was main
taining segregated facilities
in accordance with “Stat*
policy and practice” as well
as local custom. From this,
the Supreme Court majority
drew the conclusion that the
store officials were ""coerced
by the city.” Chief Justice
Warren said that ""the State
cannot achieve the same re
sult by an official command
which has at least as much
coercive effect as an ordi
nance.” There was no evi
dence that the State or city
authorities had commanded
the owner to maintain a seg
regated service. But the Su
preme Court thought a mere
statement by a city or State
official concerning a publicly
announced demonstration
amounts to the same thing.

19th Century, culminating in
the 1999 Supreme Court de
cision which sealed the whole
package with the stamp of
“separate but equal."" It was
the 1954 school Integration
decision which tore the pack
age open again, in what
Negro leaders regard with
some right as the first offi
cial reaffirmation of the
Emancipation Proclamation
in almost a century. If. as I
believe, we are In the pres

in 1980. came to the matter
of the ""sordid or timid tech

citizenship.” it added these
words:
""If this means that some
men must renounce old
ileges in order that other

then that is the way the
knife of democratic aspira

That is the way the knife

Stagnation on the Personnel Front
Administration Believed Come to a Halt
In the Hiring of New Talent
The recruiting of new tal
ent. so pronounced and ad
mired a feature of the early
days of the Kennedy admin
istration. has come to an al
most complete halt here. It
is one feature of the general
stagnation for which no ade
quate reason is apparent.
The President still is in
the first half of his third
year in office. Political ob
servers agree that, barring
some unusual crisis or Act of
God. he will be re-elected.
With five-and-a-half years
ahead of him, he faces many
problems which require all
the stature, prestige and im
agination his major appoin
tees can bring to them.
Yet he is sinking back into
a process of reshuffling jobs
and bringing forward people
of little experience and un
proved tenacity in the
clinches. There are excep
tions—the hardworking vet
eran, Averell Harriman, now
Undersecretary of State is
one but they are few. Gener
ally, promotions are of peo
ple who, like Mount Everest,
are there and can get along
with the Kennedys.
It admittedly would be dif
ficult and risky for the Presi
dent to try to galvanize a
Congress happily strangling
in its clotted web of anti
quated institutions. There are
few signs that the public is
alive to that situation. It
might be very easily aroused
if a creative and urgent ef
fort were made to arouse it,
but that course has appar
ently been ruled out.
Recruiting of talent is,
however, purely an executive
function and the consent of
the Senate can be almost
taken for granted at this
point. The Twenty-second
Amendment barring more
than two terms for a Presi
dent will make Mr. Kennedy

By ROSCOE FLEMING, Denver
Grants-in-aid is a fighting
phrase to some Americans, one
of hope to others.
Such federal aid has grown
fast and enormously •—< from
less than $1 billion yearly in
1946 to about $8 billions now.
Congress ""gives"" 40 kinds of
such aid to states.
a
Some people fear this means fed
eral control of local government. All
} it does, they say, is to send local
money to Washington, and send it
back minus a big handling charge.
But to get such a grant, each state
legislature must accept it yearly by
an affirmative act, and provide match
ing funds from local taxes. Senator
Muskie of Maine would further pro
vide that applications for urban aid
would have to be approved by a state
planning agency.
NEVER A TURN DOWN
Even states that complain they get
back much less money than they send
to Washington, never turn down a
grant. Neither do those ruled by the
loudest states'righters (such as Mon-1
tana.—PV), although to reject a
grant would create a national news
sensation to aid their battle against
federal controls"".
..
The underlying purpose and ef
fect of grants is to shunt some of
the national wealth and income
from richer areas to poorer ones,
so as to put a floor under the con
dition of all Americans. Some
wealthy states complain of this, but
some poorer ones would never pro
vide American standards for their
institutions and people without it.
.
And Prof. Daniel Elazor of Illinois
University, in his book ""The Ameri
can Partnership"", characterizes grants
as an essential part of a federal U. S,
system which sets up new goals of
civilized efficiency for the world to
match.
He says this system combines strong
central government with strong and
relatively-independent local govern
ment, in a flexible and efficient way
that gets desirable results. It avoids
both the extreme of complete cen
tralization; and that of local anarchy
and unaided misery.
Some nations give local aid without j
controls—as we originally did in the
land-grant days. Others, such as Bri
tain, simply give local governments
money in lump sums, to be spent as
the latter wish. The American sys-1
tern, generally speaking, is to grant
funds to be spent honestly for specific
purposes classed as nationally de
sirable. ""Federal control"" means no
Sometimes there's criticism, as in
the recent charges of highway-build
ing scandals. The U. S, has occasion
ally sued states, charging that the
latter were given money for one pur
pose and spent it for something else.
But overall we can be proud that
Nursing Homes Must
Meet New Standards
Effective July 1
The State Board of Health at its j
May meeting reaffirmed its policy (
regarding the enforcement on July 1,
1963, of the revised standards for (
nursing, personal care and boarding
homes.
Homes that do not meet these
standards by July 1, will not receive
a license. Under the 1947 Montana
law, the SBH is the licensing agency,
The board has given the homes
which existed on July 1, 1960, (when
the standards were adopted) three
years to meet the standards. This
time was given because the board
members realized that there would
be considerable costs involved in pro
viding sprinkler systems, fire escapes,
re-wirmg where indicated, and for
providing additional facilities in these
homes. Any new faclities, including
additions to existing homes, which
were constructed after July 1, 1960,
have had to meet these standards in
order to be licensed.

so much money can be so honestly
and efficiently dispensed and spent
for so many worthy purposes.
What, specifically, are the grants
for? The oldest, save for the orig
inal land and homestead acts, dates
back to 1879. It provides reading
material for the blind-$400,000
in 1879 and exactly the same in
1962.
Then came agricultural research,
and the Extension Service to take its
results back to the farms; followed

HIGHWAY—LARGEST OF
ALL GRANTS
The hugest grant of all, now con
suming nearly 40 per cent of the

Actually there were less than a

MONTANA G°P FOLLOWS
RIGHT ' WING LINE
The undermining attacks on the
federal government and our national
governmental institutions (the court,
1
Congress, etc.) are led by Republican
state leaders; the last two Republican
Governors have refused to proclaim
United Nations Day, a pet front fight
for the rightists; the 1961 Montana
Legislature had a bill to abolish the
federal income tax. Numerous other
extreme right-wing proposals were
incorporated in bills and resolutions
introduced in both the 1961 and 1963
sessions, including textbook tamper
ing, and restricting the power of the
federal judiciary to apportion legis
latures.
The Organization for Repeal of
the Federal Income Tax has been de
scribed by the Birch Boss as ""one
of the smaller fronts"" that has ""prob
ably accomplished more, in propor
tion to the money and effort spent,
than many of the larger organizations
of conservatives"".
The co-ordinator of the John Birch
Society, Vic Overcash, indicated the
front organizations ""indoctrinate"",
and the Birch Society then can ""move
in and take 'em over"".
The Birch Society is the ""common
denominator"" and the ""scoop"" that
will draw the brainwashed into a
common group. It is organized and
ready to go and the plan is laid out
in the Blue Book.—GGB

MONTGOMERY. Ala.-A gold

cupied by Gov. George Corley Wal
lace, a small, peppery former Judge
with a common touch and a new
quarrel with Washington.
In his simply-furnished, old
fashioned office in the capitol,
Gov. Wallace for five months has
been making plans for a show
down with the Federal Gov
ernment. A close friend says he
has been “utterly obsessed” with
it.
Because of his nationally noted
pledge to “stand In the school

he will be the man of the hour
Monday when two Negroes seek
to enroll at the University of
Alabama’s main campus In Tusca
loosa and a branch at Huntsville.
Gov. Wallace is expected to
oppose enrollment of Vivian L.
Malone, 20-year-old Negro from
Mobile, on the Tuscaloosa campus.
Alabama’s sovereignty, he says,
will be represented In his person.
For the 43-year-old Governor,
it likely will be the climax of
a political career built upon de
fiance of Washington.
A Rural Heritage
Wallace, who stands 5 feet 7
and has never weighed more than
150 pounds, is young enough to be
caught in the mainstreams of
American change in 1963. But he
is old enough to claim a sort of
log-cabin rural heritage fast dis
appearing from American life. He
is a poor country boy who rose

The ’’Fourteenth"" Was Adopted Only After a Long Fight

It has caused more litigation
than any other. It also may be
the most misunderstood.
Now it is once more entangled
In racial discrimination and dem

In view of suggestions by some

Forgotten Clauses
This is appropriate, moreover,
because two of the almost for

the five-section amendment re

particular concern in the courts

CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN
at the Black Belt cotton com
munity of Clio on August 25, 1919,
the son of a poor farmer and
grandson of a locally famous phy
sician who had traveled the Ala
bama frontier on horseback to see
his patients
In the rural South politics
starts early. When Wallace was
13 he knocked on doors in Clio
to help a candidate running for
Alabama secretary of state, and
at 16 he served briefly as a page
in the legislature In Montgomery.
A Football Player
As a 98-pound quarterback at
Barbour County High School, he
was a competitor whose wiriness
and agility made up for small
stature. He won the State Golden
Gloves bantamweight title when
he was 15 and repeated the next
year. Later he made money by
fighting a few bouts as a profes
sional in the old “smokers” that
entertained small towns.
When he went to the Univer
sity of Alabama In 1937, he was
almost penniless. His father died
a few months later, and his moth
er went to work as a sewing su
pervisor to help make their way.
Wallace waited on tables at a
boarding house for students,
worked as a clerk in the regis
trar’s office and drove a cab to
work his way through college.
When he graduated from the
university law school In 1942, he
took a temporary Job driving a
dump truck from the State High
way Department at 30 cents an
hour. He began to make frequent
visits to a dime store in Tusca
loosa to see a pretty clerk named
Lurleen Burns, then a 16-year
old high school graduate hoping
to become a nurse. They were
married in May of 1943.
By that time Wallace was a
cadet in the Army Air Corps. His
hopes for becoming a pilot van
ished when he was stricken with
spinal meningitis, which left him
critically ill. When he recovered
he became a flight engineer and
went to the Marianas with a B
-29 group assigned to raid the
Japanese mainland.
After his discharge as a flight
cope with State laws or practices
countenancing racial discrimina
tion. The administration report
edly favors working through the
interstate commerce clause of
the Constitution. The Republi
cans would rely directly on the
Fourteenth Amendment “to pro
vide the minimum tools to aid
the Negro in his valiant crusade
for equality throughout the Na
tion.”
Even before the Civil War end
ed in 1865 other kinds of differ
ences were developing not only
on how to handle the Southern
States which had seceded but
also how to safeguard the rights
of the Negro.
After Lincoln
President Lincoln’s general idea
of an executive program for post
war reconstruction was taken up
by President Johnson. A group
of House and Senate Republicans,
led by Representative Thaddeus
Stevens of Pennsylvania and sub
sequently to be called “Radicals,”
wanted to approach the problem
from the congressional angle.
They not only intended to deal
in their own way with the South
ern States but also complained
that the Lincoln-Johnson ap
proach would not assure voting
privileges and even more basic
civil rights and protections for
Negroes.
The “Radicals” as well as more
moderate members of Congress
noted with indignation or suspi
cion the so-called “Black Code”
laws which many of the South
ern States began enacting imme
diately after the war.
Mainly through the efforts of a
sergeant, Wallace saw his family
and then hitchhiked to Mont
gomery. He had connections with
Gov. Chauncey Sparks and went to
see him about a job. He became
an assistant attorney general of
Alabama.
In 1946 he won a seat as a
State Representative from his
home county. His slx-year career
as a legislator wort him State
wide attention. He championed
bills creating a Statewide network
of trade schools, setting up ma
chinery for bringing In new In
dustry and enabling small com
munities to establish natural gas
co-operatives when they could not
obtain service from private firms.
But there was not much drama
in this.
Was a State Judge
'That came after he became a
State circuit Judge for Barbour
and Bullock Counties in 1952. He
began to-preach from the bench
against the Federal Government.
In 1953 he won a brief flurry of
attention by issuing an injunc
tion against removal of segrega
tion signs in railroad terminals.
His biggest tilt with the Fed
erate came when he refused to
make voting records available to
Government investigators and was
cited for contempt of Federal
court. What followed is still a
subject of hot debate in Alabama.
United States District Judge
Frank Johnson, who had been
Wallace’s university roommate,
eventually held that Judge Wal
lace had not been In contempt
because he actually had made the
voter records available to the
agents “through devious methods.”
That decision was in early 1959.
By then Wallace had run for
Governor the first time, finishing
a strong second to John Patter
son.
When he ran again last year,
his opponents threw Judge John
son’s decision at him with glee,
charging hypocrisy. But Wallace
always denied he had helped the
Federal agents. He said they “were
defied and backed down.”
Tn a runoff campaign, he de
feated a young moderate. State
Senator Ryan deGraffenried, by a
Joint Committee on Reconstruc
tion, Congress passed a series of
bills beginning early in 1866. One
of these, the Freedmen’s Bureau
Act, included civil rights of Ne
groes under the Federal military
jurisdiction in those States. Pres
ident Johnson vetoed the bill and
was upheld in Congress.
Negroes os Citizens
But Congress soon overrode a
presidential veto of a civil rights
bill in April, 1866. That measure
provided that all persons bom in
the United States were citizens.
It thus reversed the Supreme
Court’s Dred Scott decision, that
Negroes could not hold citizen
ship. The bill also contained far
reaching provisions giving Ne
groes much the same legal and
political rights as whites.
So many doubts were raised
about constitutionality of the
1866 civil rights law that the
“Radicals""—who actually includ
ed some legislators much more
moderate than Mr. Stevens—be
gan formulating possible consti
tutional amendment proposals.
Mr. Stevens and Representative
Roscoe Conkling of New York in
troduced a constitutional amend
ment resolution early in 1866 to
cut House representation of any
State in proportion to the
abridgement of any person's po
litical rights in that State. Rep
resentatives Blaine of Maine and
Garfield of Ohio urged Mr. Ste
vens to tone down the resolution
but he refused. It was passed by
the House but rejected by the
Senate.
The Joint Committee on Re
construction several months later
The Chief Justice: A Study in Pragmatism
By SAUL PETT
Associated Press SUH Writer
For one brief moment, the Chief
Justice of the United States
savored an appetite he could no
long indulge. He was sitting in
his chambers, a tall, white-haired
man of quiet dignity. The place
was what you’d expect—a high
ceilinged room, paneled in oak,
lined richly with law books, cush
ioned in stillness, altogether a se
rene Island walled in majestic
white marble.
Quietly, Earl Warren had been
explaining that the Supreme
Court, unlike other branches of
Government, cannot engage in
public debate or even defend its
decisions from attack.
Does he sometimes wish it were
otherwise?
His dark blue eyes lighted up
and a big hand came down on
the desk, slapping it hard, crack
ing the decorous quiet.
""Oh boy!"" said the 14th Chief
Justice of the United States.
""Sometimes it makes you cringe,
to see what other people say and
write I""
Curtain Is Closed Quickly
There was no doublt that Earl
Warren, former district attorney,
attorney general and three-time
Governor of California, a man
who had been a politician most
of his adult life, would dearly
relish a chance to hit back at
his critics. The statement was
made not so much in bitterness
but in remembered scat, much like
an ex-boxer recalling how he
wotld have counter - punched in
the old days.
But having parted the curtain
5-4 margin. He said at his inaugu
ration on January 14 that the
South held the balance of United
States political power and it,
rather than “the Insipid bloc voter
sections,” would elect the next
President. He promised “segrega
tion now, segregation tomorrow,
segregation forever.”
Strong Invective seems away
of life for this jaunty, cigar-smok
ing man. He has called Attorney
General Robert F. Kennedy a
""pugnacious wilding” and a “sap
ling Caesar,"" the Federal courts
“lousy” and “irresponsible,” and
President Kennedy the boss of a
""military dictatorship.”
Even his critics grant that Mr.
Wallace has made some excellent
appointments tin his administra
tion, with a strong “cleanup” em T
phasis that follows the looser
ways of former Gov. Patterson.
Cleaned Up Scandals
A teetotaler himself, he set out
to reform the scandal-tinged State
liquor store operation. Economy
has been a strong emphasis: He
sold one of the State’s two yachts
and put the other on limited duty
for the city of Mobile; he cut
down the fleet of State automo
biles; and he called for a big cut
in his own executive department’s
budget.
Rather than use a chauffeur
driven limousine, he prefers to ride
in a police car, sitting alongside
the highway patrolman who
drives.
His racial stand remains the
chief target of criticism, some of
it from people who supported him
for Governor. They believe most
of Alabama’s leadership has
turned down another street while
Wallace has continued to march
on his collision course with the
Federal Government.
Gov. Wallace has been faced
with a constantly rising tide of
opposition on his “school
house door” pledge. Civic, reli
gious and business groups
throughout the State have adopted
""law and order” resolutions, which
are considered a warning against
defiance of Federal Integration
orders.
came up with a more compre
hensive amendment resolution
which, with some changes, even
tually became the Fourteenth
Amendment It contained a com
promise version of the defeated
Stevens-Conkling bill. But it did
not include suggestions by Ste
vens and others for outright Fed
eral granting of the voting priv
ilege to Negroes.
An earlier draft of the Four
teenth Amendment as proposed
by the Joint Committee but later
considerably modified in Repub
lican congressional caucuses
stated:
“Congress shall have power to
make all laws which shall be
necessary and proper to secure to
the citizens of each State all the
privileges and immunities of citi
zens in the several States, and
to all persons in the several States
equal protection in the rights of
life, liberty and property.”
• •
Rights Protected
As it finally emerged, the
amendment’s first section pro
vided that all persons born or
naturalized in the United States
are citizens of the United States
and the State in which they live,
and also declared:
“No State shall make or enforce
any law which shall abridge the
privileges or Immunities of citizens
of the United States; nor shall
any State deprive any person of
life, liberty or property without
due process of law; nor deny to
any person within its Jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws.""
This, therefore, centered on
State obligations and responsi
bilities. It applied to States some
momentarily, Earl Warren quickly
closed it and returned to the ivory
tower, far above the clang of pub
lic battle.
“But, of course, we cant,” he
said. “A Senator or Governor may
explain or defend his position
publicly, but not member* of the
Supreme Court. We can’t be
guided by what people think or
say except in legal discussion. We
can’t be guided by public ap
praisal. If we did, we’d be decid
ing cases by other than legal
means.”
Does the Chief Justice have any
escape valve for his suppressed re
actions?
“Yes,” he said, smiling. “I go
to baseball games and football
games and get rid of some of my
partiality that way. Also. I like
to get away with my three sons
and go fishing or duck-hunting
in California.""
A Tenth Anniversary
Next September, it will be 10
years since Earl Warren was ap
pointed Chief Justice by Presi
dent Eisenhower Although he is
now 72 and eligible for retirement
at full salary (135,000), he has
no thought of quitting soom
He continues to enjoy his Job,
the Judge said in a recent rare
interview, despite the fact that
he has been attacked more in
tensely than moat of his prede
cessors. The criticism, which in
some quarters has risen even to
shrill cries for Impeachment, gen
erally stemmed from Warren’s
opinions ort racial segregation in
schools, on the rights of individ
uals in anticommunist investiga
tions, on the constitutionality of

of the civil rights guarantees set
forth in the Fifth Amendment.
Unlike the earlier-mentioned draft,
the first section did not specify
that Congress in the first instance
could “make all laws” necessary
to secure civil rights in States.
House and Senate lost little
time in adopting the constitu
tional amendment resolution.
Hasty Approval
The method and haste with
which the Fourteenth Amendment
was ratified by the States left
much to be desired. The legality
of the adoption is still attacked
in various quarters but, unlike
the unpopular Eighteenth Amend
ment, there is no move to
repeal it.
The Thirteenth Amendment
abolishing slavery had gone
through in rapid fire fashion
when President Johnson as well
as Congress insisted that States,
North and South, ratify it in
1865. Critics of the Fourteenth
Amendment contend that its adop
tion was even more tainted be
cause ratification was often used
as a prerequisite to “readmission”
of several Southern States to the
Union.
Tennessee quickly ratified it
and was ""readmitted” in July
1866. The other 10 Southern
States rejected the amendment at
legislative sessions later that year.
Several of them ""reconsidered” in
1868. Then, Ohio and New Jersey
withdrew their ratifications. This
raised a question as to whether
and when 28 of the then 37
States provided the three-fourths
majority necessary for final adop
tion.
On July 20, 1868, Secretary of
to this kind of attack, Warren
replied quickly and firmly. ""My
reaction is that I just don’t dis
cuss it.”
Slamming doors shut on any
subject, one gathers* does not
come naturally to the Chief Jus
tice. His manner, off the bench,
is generally one of warm affabil
ity, almost a small-town folks!*
ness.
The Court's Routine
He talked easily of the court's
functions and routine. He showed
us the large, beautiful conference
room adjoining his own chambers
where the nine members of the
court usually meet on Fridays to
discuss and vote on cases after
having read all the briefs and
heard oral arguments.
These meetings are held in ut
most secrecy. Other than the nine
justices, no one. not even the
clerk of the court, is allowed in
during conference. If a law book
or document needs to be sent for,
the man who delivers it gets only
as far as the door. Who on the
inside answers his knock?
""By custom, it is usually the
newest Justice, in this case Ar
thur (Goldberg),"" Justice Warren
said, but quickly added. ""This is
not any form of hazing, don't you
know. If Arthur happens to be
busy, another justice goes to the
door. But usually it's the newest
member.”
Does the discussion in confer
ence ever warm up to hot de
bate?
""You’d be surprised at how little
heat there is in our discussions,”
said the Chief Justice. ""That's be
cause we all know what the other
State Seward conditionally certi
fied that the Fourteenth Amend
ment had become a part of the
Constitution ""if the withdrawals
of Ohio and New Jersey were in
effective.” On July 21, Georgia
ratified the amendment as South
Carolina had done on July 9. Con
gress immediately passed a joint
resolution declaring final adoption
of the amendment. On July 28,
1868, Secretary Seward certified
it unconditionally. Several other
States subsequently ratified it.
In any event, the Fourteenth
Amendment was revolutionary in
defining citizenship and Federal-
State relationships. Congressional
debates and State legislative pro
ceedings throughout the country
showed that the framers and
ratifiers of the Amendment were
well aware of this.
Corporate 'Person'
They probably had no idea how
greatly the scope and interpreta
tion of the amendment would be
extended in years to come to
many other areas besides civil
rights and how the word “person""
would later come to embrace cor
porations.
The amendment’s second sec
tion provided that the basis of a
State’s representation be’reduced
in proportion to the number of
citizens whose voting rights were
denied or abridged. For many
years that section resembled the
weather, about which many talked
but did nothing.
The NAACP Legal Defense
Fund recently filed a Federal
Court suit to test that section.
The NAACP estimates that if
the section were strictly enforced
man's basic views are and we
respect them. But many times
there is an accommodation that
can be reached.
“It is all very informal and
there's very little Irritation shown
in conference. We take the cases
in the order in which we heard
them. The Chief Justice starts by
stating his opinion on the first
case, usually in two or three
minutes.
“Then the other justices, in or
der of seniority, state their in
dividual views without interrup
tion. Then, after some dis
cussion. I ask if we are ready for
a vote. Bv custom, the newest
justice votes first and so on up
the seniority ladder.”
Long Discussion
The length of discussion varies
although most cases are disposed
of within one day’s conference.
“Sometimes the little cases,
which you woudn't think would
be any trouble, take an hour and
a half or more Sometimes the im
portant cases go quickly. But in
any event, if any one member of
of the court wants more time to
study and discuss a case, we sim
ply put it over to a later con
ference.""
After a vote is taken the Chief
Justice, if he sides with the ma
jority, assigns the writing of the
majority opinion. He may take the
job himself or ask another jus
tice to write it. Among the dis
senting members, the senior mem
ber in that group assigns the
writing of their opinion.
Once written, the opinions are
then sent down, again in com
plete secrecy, to a carefully
guarded print shop tn the court's
basement. Once printed they still

the Southern States could lose
about 25 of their more than 100
House seats. t -
The Amendment's third and
fourth sections are obsolete be
cause they deal with Southern
participants in the Civil War and
with United States assumption of
debts of States that seceded. -
How Powerful?
The fifth section provides that
“Congress shall have power to en
force by ""appropriate legislation
the provisions of this article,"" the
Fourteenth Amendment. The Su
preme Court has never yet de
termined or defined the full pa
tent of the power of Congress to
protect civil rights under Sec
tion 5. , •
Acting under Section 5, Con
gress in 1875 passed the Civil
Rights Acts. One major provision
made it a misdemeanor for pro
prietors of inns, public convey
ances, theaters and other places
of amusement to deny “equal en
joyment of their facilities on ac
count of race, color or previous
condition of servitude.” The Su
preme Court held that and several
other provision unconstitutional
in 1883. The court declared that
the amendment’s opening section
referred to positive acts by State
officials and not to acts by private
individuals.
For almost three-quarters of a
century Congress has shown little
inclination or enough votes to'do
anything under the amendment’s
Section 5. Now it is being urged
increasingly to enact some “ap
propriate legislation,” not neces
sarily to get back to 1868 but to
face realities of 1963.
remain secret until actually an
nounced from the bench.
It has often been said that the
main job of a Supreme Court
Justice, that of studying the facts
and arriving at an opinion, is
primarily a lonely assignment.
""It isn’t necessarily.” said the
Chief Justice ""We talk with one
another. We all feel free to drop
in on other justices. We don’t
have to sit here and sweat out a
decision alone
""It can be exciting, bringing
about agreement, finding a com
mon ground Sometimes this is
very difficult Justice < Felix >
Frankfurter once showed me what
was the 34th printed draft of an
opinion by Justice <Louis) Braq
deis. And this was after confer
ence.
“But the net result was
that they finally got a unanimous
court on that case. So often men
can agree on the result but not on
the route by which they reach it.""
The Public's Knowledge
Does the Chief Justice think the
public suffers from any miscog
ceptions about the court? , •
""There is a great lack of know
ledge about the court and its
function even among a large per
centage of the bar."" he said.
""They don’t follow our cases very
closely. Some of this is due to the
nature of our work and the way
the public gets news of it.
""We can't discuss cases public
ly We have to be very careful.
That's why I go to a minimum of
social functions in Washington
Often people I meet ask me ques
tions they shouldn’t Do you rea

Order Must Prevail
The Supreme Court did not say why
It refused last week to dissolve a tempo
rary State court Injunction banning
mass demonstrations in Jackson, Missis
sippi, without a permit.
In its appeal, the NAACP said the
Injunction had been issued without
notice, that it forbade the right of
•‘peaceful protest,” and that it con
stituted a gross denial of constitutional
rights.
It seems clear, however, that the
danger of large-scale violence in Jack
son is very real And in the face of a
clear and present danger, the Federal
authority should not be used to make
it Impossible for local authorities to
take all reasonable measures to prevent
violence. To be sure, this may entail an
impairment of what otherwise would be
constitutionally protected rights. One is
reminded, however, of Justice Holmes’
admonition that the constitutional right
of free speech does not Include the right
to shout fire in a crowded theater.
Nearer home, the situation seems
only slightly less threatful in Cambridge,
Md. There, a limited form of martial
law prevails and armed Guardsmen
patrol the streets. A racial clash appar
ently was averted Friday night when
Stanley Branch, a field representative
for the NAACP, successfully urged an
unruly crowd of Negroes to disperse and
go home. His theme was: “We can never
justify anything we do as a mob.”
The next day, however, still another
NAACP spokesman, Philip Savage, was
serving an ultimatum on the city offi
cials, and threatening to bring 10,000
demonstrators into Cambridge to stage
hourly demonstrations.
Informed of this, Brig. Gen. George
Gelston, Governor Tawes’ representative
and commander of military units in
Cambridge, said he was “sure the State
government would act to prevent such
a large force of outsiders from entering
the city.” We also think the State not
only will but should prevent the carrying
out of any such threat as this.
Wanted— j 4 Good Job
President Kennedy has been meet
ing in private with a large group of labor
leaders In an effort to pierce the barriers
which stand between Negroes and good
jobs. We wish the President every suc
cess, and we hope that some good results
will come out of this undertaking, as
well as other efforts which he has been
making.
Os more Immediate interest, how
ever, is a news report from our reporter,
Lee Cohn, to the effect that the national
construction unions are putting the heat
on their locals, particularly in Washing
ton, to cease and desist from practices
which for many years have barred quali
fied Negroes from jobs on local building
projects.
The practical result of this national
union proposal, as we understand it, is
to make the contractor responsible for
deciding whether an applicant for a job,
white or colored, has the requisite quali
fications. If the contractor decides that
a Negro is qualified, he will hire him.
And the local union, under the national
union edict, must accept the Negro for
membership in the local.
It is not our purpose to suggest that
this, alone, will solve the problem of
discrimination. But it is a big, and
maybe a giant, step forward. For it is
our idea that most Negroes, when things
shake down, will be more interested in
an equal shot at jobs for which they are
qualified than in any of the rights
currently at issue.
Sukarno, Westward Ho?
It seems only yesterday that Indo
nesia and the Philippines were bitterly
opposing the projected formation of the
Federation of Malaysia. But now they
have worked out with Malaya, the fed
eration’s heart, a “complete agreement
on how to resolve problems of common
concern arising out of the proposal to
establish” the new nation in the weeks
immediately ahead.
This is encouraging news. What it
means, if words may be taken at face
value, is that the federation will be al
lowed to come into being without any
violent counteraction, verbal or other
wise, by the Indonesians or the Filipinos
as regards certain territorial claims they
have in Malaysia. Instead, the* claims
will be submitted to a kind of interna
tional arbitration board, whose findings
all parties concerned have apparently
agreed to accept.
Even more significant, however, is
the fact that the accord reached by the
three countries at their ministerial
meeting in Manila includes provisions
aimed at working out a pact of mutual
defense against “subversion in any form
or manifestation.” Indonesia, the Phil
ippines and Malaya—especially the lat
ter—have very large numbers of Chinese
in their population, and they are wor
ried about how Communist China, which
seems eager to gobble up everything in
that part of the world, might be able to
use these people to promote its expan
sionist ambitions. Hence, in effect, the
Manila agreement on this matter
amounts to a sort of alliance against
Peking.
All this Is particularly noteworthy
when one recalls that Indonesia's Presi-
MONDAY, JUNE 17, 1963
dent Sukarno, who recently played host
to Red China’s chief of state, has long
been acting the role of a “neutralist”
in the cold war. In the process—up to
now, that Is—he has given every indica
tion of being more pro-Communlst than
pro-West. But today, even though it
may be a mirage, everything looks re
markably different.
Maybe Red China’s attack on India
accounts for the phenomenon. In any
case, whatever the reason, “neutralist""
Dr. Sukarno now has seen fit to align
himself with the altogether anti-Com
munlst and pro-Western Malayan and
Filipino republics. Change is a funda
mental law of life, and in this Instance
it certainly seems all to the good.
Ars Gratis
We welcome the President’s creation
of an Advisory Council on the Arts. Car
rying on the work begun by August
Heckscher as White House consultant on
the arts, the council, composed of the
.heads of relevant departments and 30
art-involved citizens, may be expected
to produce about 40 times as many lec
tures on art as Mr. Heckscher did. The
over-all quality of the rhetoric will prob
ably not be as high as his, but certainly
more listeners can be reached. ,
Will the council do anything else?
It seems unlikely. For the hard fact is
that for Government to discharge its
responsibilities to the arts, It has to
spend money on them. While every ma
jor and middle-sized country in the
world does that, no American admin
istration in over 20 years has been will
ing to do so. The New Frontier’s cele
brated concern for the arts has so far
been limited to expressions of esteem
and to upgrading the after-dinner enter
tainment at the White House.
If anyone connected with the new
enterprise is really serious about it, there
is one obvious place to begin. The
services and the space agency all have
art programs based on conning artists
into working without pay. This deplor
able practice should be reformed at once.
It may be true that America is not yet
ready to join the rest of civilization in
public support for art, but a giant step
forward would be to stop Government
free-loading on artists.
Downtown Renewal
A year ago the urgently needed Dis
trict legislation to authorize the use of
urban renewal powers in commercial
areas passed the House in a breeze and
fell apart in the Senate District Com
mittee. Now the Senate committee has
vigorously Indorsed the measure and the
greatest hurdle to its enactment appears
ironically to be in the House.
The reason for this doubt lies en
tirely In the fact that the House District
Committee is currently conducting a
lengthy and somewhat disconnected in
quiry into virtually every aspect of the
Washington renewal program, with em
phasis on specific projects proposed or
under way. This inquiry, however,
should not be allowed to interfere with
the simple clarification of law embodied
in the Senate bill. This legislation is
the key to our “Downtown Progress”
plan. It is vital to Washington. It
already has been carefully considered
by the House committee. And it would
do no more than give to the District
the same right which nearly every other
major American city already possesses
to utilize urban renewal as one of the
necessary tools to revitalize its old and
deteriorating commercial areas.
Cheers, Mr. Schriner
Here’s a name to remember: A. W.
Schriner. Just A. W. Schriner, inventor,
he is listed now. But one day it could
be A. W. Schriner, Nobel Prize winner.
Blessed with luck, Imagination and
ingenuity, Mr. Schriner has made a fjpe
start. He has Invented just the thing
chickens have needed all this time—
contact lenses. That’s right, red plastic
lenses which are fitted between the
chicken’s double eyelids.
The results are most happy and
salubrious for both chicken and chicken
raiser. Naturally, everything the chicken
sees now is rose-colored. This calms
the nerves, cutting down on costly egg
breakage. The fowl eats more leisurely
and doesn’t wastefully scatter com.
Finally, we are happy to report, she
seems to be restrained from the un
pleasant habit of barnyard cannibalism.
Well, Mr. Schriner is not stopping
there. He already Is thinking of turkeys
and pigs with contact lenses. Soon the
entire animal world could be wearing
rose-tinted specs. And that could make
It so peaceful with the so-called lower
forms that man's many malefactions
would stand out more nastily than ever.
So there Is where Mr. Schriner
scores his final and greatest triumph.

On Amendments
David Lawrence is correct
in stating that we need a
new amendment to the
United States Constitution,
but it should be vastly differ
ent from what he suggests.
Now that the John Birchers,
with enormous funds, are •
taking over the sparsely pop
ulated States like Wyoming,
we need an amendment to
Article V that will provide
that after an amendment to
the Constitution has been
proposed by the Congress it
shall become a part of the
Constitution when it has been
ratified by legislatures or con
ventions in States containing
three-fourths of the total
population of the Union, ac
cording to the latest census.
At the time our Federal
Constitution was adopted,
the disparity between the
most populous and the least
populous States was nowhere
near as great as it is today.
Urban and suburban areas
are badly underrepresented
in the legislatures of most
States, and because of this
they are also underrepre
sented in the United States
House of Representatives.
Everybody knows that they
are underrepresented in the
United States Senate.
Filibusters in the Senate
and the Rules Committee in
the House have been added
to this underrepresentation,
with the result that the Pres
ident and the Supreme Court
have had to take part of the
legislative function from Con
gress to prevent the Consti
tion from becoming hope-
unworkable.
A second amendment to the
Constitution which would be
very helpful would give the
Vice President of the United
States exclusive Jurisdiction
to reapportion the legisla
tures of the several States,
including the power to change
the size of the branches of
the legislatures. A third
amendment would requre
that all State legislatures be
unicameral (and the Gov
ernor of each State would
designate which chamber
would survive). A fourth
amendment would abolish
the poll tax in State elections
(taking up where the 34th
Amendment leaves off). For
the benefit of David Law
rence, a fifth amendment
would renew and confirm the
actions of the Congress in
proposing, and of the States
in ratifying, the 13th and 14th
and 15th Amendments, and
would repeal the 10th Amend
ment.
These five suggested amend
ments would bring our Fed
eral Constitution up to date.
When urban and suburban
areas are fairly represented
in State legislatures there is
a good chance that Negroes
will not have to engage in
street demonstrations.
Charles W. Cobb, Jr.
White on Rights
According to William 8.
White, “If a shopkeeper can
be compelled by unexampled
Federal force (a new civil
rights bill or a Supreme
Court decision • to serve all
who appear there and if on
refusing his business can be
disrupted with Fedejal bless
ing by demonstrators swarm
ing in from the streets, the
institution of private prop
erty is finished.”
Now. Mr. White, let us
examine what you say a bit
more closely. To begin, .do
you think that the right of
property today is ""finished”
in Washington, D. C? Os
course not. Yet a restaurant
or hotel owner tn this city
must accommodate all cus
tomers without regard to
race, color or creed, and has
been forced to do so by law
.for the last ten years. The
same lawful obligation exists
in hundreds of cities
throughout the land, and is
observed wjth few complaints
on anyone's part.
But to answer your funda
mental proposition: I sub
mit that if such a law were
made national, it would not
“finish"" private property
rights. Rather, It would force
establishments licensed by
the public to do what they
should have been required to
do long ago. le., serve that
public, not just a fixed per
centage of it. This obligation
transcends any “right” of

private property a bigoted
store owner may claim.
As for your objection to
demonstrations as such:
What, Mr. White, were your
ancestors doing circa 1776?
Writing editorials for Loyalist
newspapers entitled “A Bet
ter Way Than Tea Parties.”?
Andrew Moursund, Jr.
Anti-Diem
The tragic picture of a
Buddhist monk cremating
himself as a sacrificial pro
test against the religious in
tolerance of Ngo Dinh Diem
should bring us to our senses.
The cause of democracy in
South Viet Nam will be for
ever lost if the United States
continues to support the
dictatorial and repressive
Diem. His arrogant refusal to
let the Buddhists fly their
flag over, their pagodas is
only the most recent in
a long series of oppressive
measures.
The Viet Cong rebels sur
vive and prosper mainly be
cause the peasants detest the
Diem government, which is
honeycombed with graft and
nepotism. We are not, how
ever, faced with the alter
native of supporting Diem
versus a Viet Cong take-over.
American policy - makers
should withdraw our military
and financial support of
Diem and back a coalition
of the democratic elements
Diem has forced into prison
or exile.
Peter Irons.
e* e e
The brutality and religious
persecution in President
Diem's regime is now di
rectly before the American
public.
Diem's use of Catholicism
as a political arm of his
despotism not only does dis
service to the Catholic
Church, especially in Viet
Nam, but plays into the eager
hands of the Communists.
His attempts to shift the re
sponsibility for his errors
by accusing Buddhist priests
of being Communists are lud
icrous.
Perhaps the greatest trag
edy of all is America’s un
witting role in this drama.
The use of modern M-11S
armored amphibious person
nel carriers guarding the
streets of Hue, and the use
of American transports to
fly the Diem police to squash
the non - violent Buddhist
demonstrations can only in
crease the growing contempt
for the American image both
in Viet Nam and throughout
Asia.
It is with sadness that
Vietnamese nationalists re
call the original Ideals and
goals of the American effort
in South Viet Nam—“to ad
vise and train Vietnamese to
defend their freedom against
Communist aggression.” The
U. 8. can no longer disassoci
ate itself from the ideological
infirmities of the Saigon feu
dal regime if it continues to
supply the arms and money
necessary for new crimes
against the Vietnamese peo
ple.
The only hope for Viet
Nam lies in the hands of
the antl-Communist nation
alists. Capable and energetic
leaders are waiting to as
sume their responsibilities.
Provided with these leaders
and given Ideals for which
to fight, the Vietnamese na
tion will rise from apathy
and show that greatness
which has always been its
salvation in times of great
peril.
Tran Van Tung.
Secretary General,
Vietnam Democratic Party.

Pointed Question
Don Bacon, in an article
entitled ""Hodges Declares
Space Research Should Pay
Off in Daily Life,” quotes a
Washington housewife as re-
cently asking, ""If we have
enough technical knowledge
to put men in space, why
does my washing machine
break down so often?”
The article continues: ""This
question, which goes to the
heart of a serious problem
in the United States, has no
easy answer.” The answer is
quite simple. It is the old,
correction, it is the recent
American custom among
manufacturers; make it
showy, make it as cheap as
possible, and get as much
out of it as possible. It is as
simple as that.
William C. Cale.
Man and Space
The front-page article of
June 10 by William Hines is
the story of but one man’s
views aired before the Senate
Space Committee. It implies
that the editor of “Science”
is the holy ghost of all sci
ence. Among other gross mis
representations is his report
ed straw poll resulting in a
110 to 3 score against man
in space. When have scien
tists ever been in such agree
ment on any subject?
The imagination of all men
has been caught up by man’s
role in space. A few parochial
scientists of limited vision
may try to hold back this
flood of public opinion but in
the broad sweep of history
their pitiful protests will not
even be remembered.
This is the space age, the
time of man’s conquest of
space, the time when men
recognize that a conquest has
begun, and that the contest
ants have national identifica
tions. And our team is The
United States of America.
Paul W. Schafer, M. D.
No Czar, Please
Your editorial “No FCC
Czar, Please” must make
sense to some people who
still apart from memories of
how the ""czar” concept
worked out for another
United States regulatory
body, the Federal Aviation
Agency.
The authority for that con
cept in the FAA still legally
exists under the Federal Avi
ation Act passed by Con
gress in 1058. However, the
agency was somewhat forced
by adverse reactions to the
czar type of operation to
more or less turn toward the
thought expressed in your
editorial: "" despite the
nasty things people say about
committees, it is yet to be
proved that one man’s de
cisions. extended over a long
series of problems, are apt
to be an improvement pn
those of a group freely ex
changing ideas.”
It is to be hoped that your
thoughts will have some in
fluence to cause the Con
gress to stop, look and listen
before it takes to some of
Mr. Minow’s ideas on how
the FCC should be organized.
Robert E. Trimble.

Assateague View
tn Assateague Island, the
State of Maryland and Wor
cester County have a price
less asset that it now seems
everybody wants. If the Gov
ernor of Maryland goes back
on his word and promises
to the private property own
ers, he will not only show
that he has been politically
pressured into giving away
Maryland's most valuable
real estate, but he will also
allow this island to be tied
up in court proceedings that
could last for another 10 to
15 years, because I am sure
that every property owner
'over 5,000) will fight this
take-over to the bitter end.
I ask only two questions
about the 15 miles of the
island held in private owner
ship:
Does the State of Mary
land want the moot modem
beach development on the
entire Atlantic seaboard? Or
does it want this island (pri
vately owned portion) prac
tically given away to the
Federal Government and tied
up for years in court pro
ceedings that in the end will
leave it not much different
then its present state?

THE PASSING SCENE
By WILLIAM S. WHITE
Kennedy's Overseas Trip
Those professional “liber
als” who seek to dissuade
President Kennedy from his
forthcoming and first of
ficial visit to two of our
Western Allies, Italy and
Free Germany, are showing
what is, even for them, a
curlqusly total blindness.
It is a masterwork, a
magnum opus, of sentimental
vyrong-headedness for those
whose invariable certainty of
their rightness in all matters
is matched only by their
rarely failing capacity to
miss the real point in any
thing that matters very much
at all.
It is said that the Presi
dent shouldn't go—not now,
anyhow—because Italy is in
political confusion. It is said
that the President shouldn’t
go because the Papacy has
not been filled since the
death of Pope John. It is
said that the President
shouldn’t go because of the
current racial tensions in
the United States.
Italy Needs Help
And it is also implied—
though rarely quite said—
that the President at any rate
should not visit Germany.
The unuttered reasoning here
is that nothing should be
done to give status to the
new Germany because of the
ghastly crimes of the old.
Hitler Germany against
mankind.
To take up these objec
tions:
The fact is that for the
President to cancel his jour
ney to Italy would be to court
the gravest risk of contribut
ing to the outright collapse
of the already hard-pressed
and faithfully pro-Western
government of Premier Amin
tore Fanfani.
Hardly two months ago,
Fanfani barely survived Ital
ian elections which mani
fested a menacing rise in the
power of an ugly Communist
minority. For nearly two dec
ades this minority has been
biting at free government in
that highly Important allied
land.
Italy needs all the assist
ance we can give. The last
thing, surely, she needs is a
public snub from the head
of the Western world. As to
A BOOK FOR TODAY
By DONALD MINTZ
For Lovers of Classical Greece
THE ANCIENT GREEKS.
An Introduction to Their
Life and Thought. By M. I.
Finley. (Blus. 177 pp. Vik
ing Press; |5.)
Open M. I. Finley’s “The
Ancient Greeks” at random.
It is virtually certain that
something interesting will
appear: “The questions
which exercised the philoso
phers, of all schools and
tendencies, were how man
should best come to terms
with the unchanging condi
tions that bound human life,
not only with the superna
tural but also with existence
in a community (man being
by nature gregarious) and
with harsh material circum
stances (there being no con
ception of continuous tech
nological progress); how to
live happily; how to deter
mine the correct values and
norms, and then how to
bring them into practice. The
emphasis was almost exclu
sively on this life, further
more. Even Plato, strongly
influenced as he was by Py
thagoreanism and perhaps by
the religious movement
known as Orphism, obsessed
as he was with the soul.
In his practical ethics was
fundamentally earthbound.”
Or this on the origin of
Greek science: ""WhatJs the
world? What is man? These
were not new questions. But
previously the answers were
mythical; they were stories,
often with a genealogical
quality or flavour. Earth
gave birth to the sky. Zeus,
Poseidon and Hades were
three brothers who over
threw the Titans and divided
the universe among them
selves Into three realms.
Man was created. Such
mythical answers are world
wide In one form or another,
and their quality as explana
tion is always essentially
the same. Myth is specific
and concrete, explaining
both natural and human
phenomena by reference to
particular supernatural
events or actions, in them
selves unaccountable. The
lonian revolution was sim
ply this, that Thales and his
successors asked generalized
questions and proposed gen
eral, rational, ‘lmpersonal’
answers. To be sure, they be
gan by naive speculation, and
such suggestions as ’The
earth stays in place through
floating like a log* do not
get us very far. Nevertheless,
it is Impossible to overesti
mate the boldness of the es-

Q. Who originated the
dance, the mambo? R>.
A. The mambo is said to
have been originally devised
about IMS by Peres Prado,
a Cuban bandleader. He com
bined syncopation with the
basic rhythms of a dance
popular among sugar • cane
workers.
Q. Is the pipslssewa an
evergreen?—H. O.
A. The pipslssewa (Chlma
phlla umbellate) is a low
the Papacy, only the most
credulously silly would be
lieve that the President had
come over to hover around
the Vatican, lobbying for
some private candidate for
the succession to the noble
Pope John.
As to the racial issue at
home, to call off this Presi
dential mission on the theory
that the President should
remain here instead and
make some theatrical per
sonal gesture at some school
house or lunchroom sit-in
would be folly beyond com
prehension.
Those who urge such a
tasteless course in political
hucksterism are unmindful
of more than simply the
gross hazards of exposing the
dignity of the Presidential
office to street scenes of
disorder and violence.
What do these people—who
endlessly yammer that we
must at all times pay heed
to “world opinion”—suppose
“world opinion” would be In
these circumstances?
“World opinion” and
even rational and respon
sible world opinion, for that
matter—would conclude that
this Nation stood so close
to anarchy that the Presi
dent of the United States
dared not leave its borders.
Germany Indispensable
As to West Germany, the
United States many years
ago adopted her as an ally,
for the plain and single
reason that she Is Indispen
sable in the great contest
with the Soviet Union.
This is a decision long
made. To attempt in effect
to reverse it now would be
madness. Nobody knows this
better than, for example, the
Israelis—who have, Heaven
knows, quite enough reason
to remember the old Ger
many.
The bottom truth is that
those who . are so full of
“protests” at this Presidential
visit to our Western Allies
would be caroling joyfully
about if the President were
going hat in hand, say, to
neutralist India or, better
yet, to some pompous con
clave of “African leaders” in
some dreary place like Ghana.
(Copyrisht, 1953)
fort itself, or the significance
for the future of intellectual
endeavour.""
These two long quotations
are offered byway of demon
strating the extraordinary
nature of this little book. Dr.
Finley, an American-born
fellow of Jesus College, Cam
bridge, has not tried to write
a history of Greece in 177
pages. The result would have
been an excruciating proces
lon of unintegrated facts.
Nor, on the other hand,
has he produced a souffle of
unsupported conclusions. He
has tried, he says, ""to ex
plain how Greek civilization
developed in its various as
pects, its strengths and
weaknesses, materially, so
cially, politically, culturally.
The emphases, and the omis
sions too, reflect my own
judgment of what is most
interesting and important in
Greek history."".
So we have summary
studies of what Dr. Finley
takes to be the essence of
this or that aspect of Greek
life. He goes far beneath
the surface; at the same
time he supports his theories
with facts, and—just as im
portant-indicates where the
attrition of time seems to
have distorted (or destroyed)
' the record.
“The Ancient Greeks."" for
all its selectivity, proceeds
chronologically, so that it
affords a general picture
of the development of Greek
society. It is always very dif
ficult to blend the chrono
logical and the topical ap
proaches, and the shorter the
book, the greater the diffi
culty. Dr.yFinley has over
come the problems, and this
in itself accounts for a good
part of his success.
Perhaps even more impor
tant is his feel for the na
ture of human society. The
rational and the irrational
are legitimate opposite poles,
and one or the other may
dominate at any given time
in a human community,
though judgment is likely to
be highly subjective. But
what is more Important is
the blending of the two in
various aspects and strata of
society. Careful study by it
self will not illuminate the
nature of the bend; one
needs Dr. Finley's sense of
society.
""The Ancient Greeks” is
intended for the general
reader. It is fair to assume
that not many are passion
ate lovers of classical antiq
uity. Perhaps Dr. Finley will
make a few converts.

Area Schools Consider
Discretionary Bible Use
By DAVID BREASTED
autr autt Writer
A mornins ritual familiar to feneration* of District public
school children will end next Monday when summer school
begins for 8,500 pupils.
An order from Bupt. Carl T. Hansen yesterday suspended
the preecribed readings from the Bible and recitations of the
Lord’s Prayer following the Supreme Court decision «,galnst
such required devotional ex
ercises.
Throughout the Washington,
area, school authorities in sys
tems without formal require,
msnts for opening exercises
pondered what course to follow
on procedures left to the dis
cretion of school staffs.
Await Board Action
In the District, only the
formality of action by the
board of education remained
for removal of the rule whoee
antecedents date far back into
the l#th century. Board Presi
dent Wesley 8. Williams and
Dr. Hansen both said they an
ticipate action at the June 26
board meeting.
“We should Immediately ad
just to the Supreme Court ac
tion. We have an unenforce
able rule here. 1 ' Dr. Hansen
said. He issued the new ban
after informal consultation
with the Corporation Counsel's
office.
One observer there said that
as a result of the court ruling,
not only was the board rule
“out the window,” but infor
mal practices would probably
be suspect.
If Bible reading and the
Lord's Prayer were ""used sur
reptitiously to accomplish a
devotional purpose, that would
be violative,"" this legal source
said.
There were mixed and cau
tious reactions from officials
in six nearby school jurisdic
tions, some of which have
guidelines but no school board
or administration requirements
for opening exercises. The form
and content of opening exer
cises are left up to school fac
ulties and sometimes individual
classroom teachers.
James G. Stockard. head of
the Arlington County school
board, said that in the light
of the decision he would object
to prayer or Bible reading
“where a teacher is imposing
a requirement that the class
recite something.”
But he said that where pupils
decided on the issue “by demo
cratic process, and the major
ity feel that they would like
to do something. I would see
nothing wrong with that. I
would be willing to be the de
fendant in that.”
Mr. Stockard said he doubted
the informal Arlington prac
tices would come up for debate
in the board unless a citizen or
student objects on grounds of
“separation of church and
state.” Then, ho said, the
board would investigate, with
the advice of its attorney.
Arlington Schoo) Supt. Ray
C. Reid had no comment on
the implications of the deci
sion.
Montgomery Uncertain
. In Montgomery County, Bupt.
C. Taylor Whittier admitted
the future of individual school
policies of staff and parents
on prayer looked uncertain.
Charles W. Prettyman. attor
ney for the school board, de
clined to say whether the deci
sion would affect present cus
tom. But to date, he said, he
was ""unaware that we were
doing anything illegal.”
Prince Georges Supt. William
E. Schmidt said that if the
school board decides the deci
sion applies to the discretion
ary practices there, ""they'll
take action.”
Fairfax County Supt. Earl
Funderburk would make no
comment to a reporter who
asked him for details on prac
tices in county schools.
In Falls Church. Supt. Irvin
H. Schmitt said ""eome esy it’s
pretty plain” the decision rules
out informal exercises in city
school*.
Bupt. John C. Albohm of
Alexandria Mid his system
would ask for interpretation of
the decision from the Com
monwealth's Attorney.
DiMppeiated. O'Beyle Say*
For the Catholic Archdiocese
of Washington. Archbishop Fat
rick A. O’Boyle declared in a
prepared statement that “The
Supreme Court’s decision is dis
appointing It is obvious that
little by little the court is die
carding religious tradition* hal
lowed by a century and a half
of American practice.""
As they studied the situation,
a spokesman for the Jewish
Community Council of Greater
Washington expressed ""serious
doubts” about even the tinging
of Christmas earol* if rehearsed
and performed on school time.
Isaac Franck, the council’s
executive director, also said
that court's decision applied to
observances of Jewish or any
other holiday* unless school ex
hibits or songs were incorpo
rated as illustrations in com
parative studies.
A statement signed by Rich
ard K. Lyon, president of the
Jewish Community Council, and
Mr. Franck, said the council is
""heartened that the Supreme
Court ha* spoken again for re
ligious freedom, and for the
right of every American to
make his own decision as to his
prayers and devotional observ
ances, without governmental in
terference.""

Ruling Stresses Neutrality on Religion
By DANA BULLEN
■Ur Blatt Wnwr
The Supreme Court'* action
barring required devotional use
of the Bible and Lord's Prayer
in publie school* doe* not In*
dicate hostility toward religion,
but rather that Government
muit remain strictly neutral in
religious matters.
Justice Clark, who delivered
the 1-1 majority opinion yes*
terday. took pains to limit the
decision to ths barring of or*
ganiaed devotional exerciMS
""The place of religion in our
society is an exalted one,
achieved through a long tradi
tion of reliance on the home,
the chureh and the inviolable
citadel of the individual heart
and mind,"" he Mid
He emphasized that religion
ha* been eloeely identified with
our history and Government
""We are a religious people
whose institutions presuppose a
Supreme Being,"" he noted that
the court has said.
Freedom also a Factor
But. he went on. ""This is not
to my .. that religion has been
so identified with our history
■nd Government that religious
freedom is not likewise ss
strongly imbedded in our pub
lic and private life.""
The requirement that religi
ous exercises, namely the Bible
and Lord's Prayer opening ex
ercises, start th* public school
day. he said, violate* this idea
of religious freedom under the
Constitution.
The test, he said, is this:
EXCERPTS FROM OPINION
Court Restricts Public School Prayers
Here are excerpts from the
text of the majority opinion
written by Justice Clark, in
the Supreme Court’t decision
on school prayers}
Once again we are called
upon to consider the scope of
the provision of the First
Amendment... which declares
that “Congress shall make no
law respecting an establish
ment of religion or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof. . . .’*
These companion cases pre
sent the Issues In the context
of State action requiring that
schools begin each day with
readings from the Bible. . . .
In light of the history of the
first amendment and of our
cases Interpreting and applying
its requirements, we hold that
the practices at issue and the
laws requiring them are un
constitutional under the estab
lishment clause, as applied to
the States through the 14th
Amendment.
It is true that religion has
been closely Identified with
our history and Govern
ment. . . . The fact that the
Founding Fathers believed de
votedly that there was a God
and that the unalienable
rights of man were rooted in
him is clearly evidenced in
their writings, from the May
flower Compact to the Consti
tution itself.
Evidence in Public Life
This background is evidenced
today in our public life through
the continuance in our oaths of
office from the presidency to
the alderman of the final sup
plication, “so help me God.”
Likewise each House of the
Congress provides through Its
chaplain an opening prayer,
and the sessions of this court
are declared open by the crier
In a short ceremony, the final
phrase of which Invokes the
grace of God.
Again, there are such mani
festations in our military forces,
where those of our citizens who
are under the restrictions trf ,
military service wish to engage
tn voluntary worship. Indeed. 1
only last year an official survey
of the country indicated that 64 '
per cent of our people have '
church membership. . . . while
less than I per cent profess no 1
religion whatever .. . 1
This is not to say, however, I
that religion has been so identi- 1
fled with our history and gov- I
eminent that religious free- 1
dom is not likewise as strongly 1
Imbedded in our public and-I
private life . ..
Diversity of Opinion
Thia freedom to worship was •
indispensable In a country l
whose people came from the <
four quarters of the earth and i
brought with them a diversity i
of religious opinion. Today au- '
thoritiea list S 3 separate religi- 1
ous bodies, each with member- <
, ships exceeding 50,000, exist
j ing among our people, as well I
as Innumerable smaller groups i
...This court has decisively '
; settled that the First Amend-
’ will provide a guide in discon
tinuing publie school religious
rituals and observances. For
the people, the decisions should i
. be a reminder of our duty to
i provide for our children a gen- :
uine and meaningful religious :
education and to make our
homes and churches and syna- 1
pogues true citadels of deep and
challenging religious faith.” 1
Bishop John Wesley Lord of <
the Methodist Church, resident i
in the Washington area, said <
the decision may, in the long i
run, “moot truly conserve the i
Christian values that lie at the l
heart of our Christian faith i
and of our American democ
racy.” i
He said that although the
ruling may result “in some loh i
in the schools,” the loss “can i
be and must be compensated i
for by the recognition that the i
primary responsibility for roll- I
gious training ruts with the .
home and the church.” (
By relegating traditional roll- i
gious training “to a secular i
agency,” Blahop Lord Hid. “we i
INTERPtfTIVE REPORT
Doe* the State action advance
or inhibit religion? if it does
either, he continued, then it
exceeds the extent of Govern
ment Involvement permitted by
th* Founders.
Th* court, in a separate ac
tion. returned to Florida courts
a Miami school ease in which
the highest State court had up
held Masonal hymn singing,
baccalaureate services and art
um of religious symbols
Whether these, and other
activities, meet or violate con
stitutional standard* will prob
ably be presented to the high
court in the future for decision.
The uncertainty, meanwhile,
may eauM problems.
While yesterday's decision
dealt with Government re
quired devotional exercises,
there appeared to be little—if
any—roem under the opinions
for teacher* to plan such exer
cises themselves.
Agents of State
The teachers, as government
employe* operaUng in govern
ment-owned facilities on gov
ernment time, probably could
be considered as agents of the
State. Thu*, they probably
would be bound by the same
standards.
One major area was covered
by th* court in yesterday's
opinion. Justice Clark made it
clear that ths First Amend
ment does not bar study of the
Bible or religion as part of va
rious secular subjects.
""It might well be Mid that
one's education is not complete
ment’s mandate thafCongrem
shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise
thereof"" has been made wholly
i applicable to the States by the
114th Amendment.
! Second, this court has re
looted unequivocally the con
tention that the establishment
clause forbids only govern
’ mental preference of one rell
, gion over another. Almoat 30
years ago in Everson, supra, at
, 11, the court said that “neither
: a State nor the Federal Gov
ernment can Mt up a church.
Neither can pom laws which
' aid one religion, aid all re
. llgions, or prefer one religion
‘ over another.” . . .
t While none of the parties of
, these cases has questioned
, these basic conclusions of the
, court, both of which have been
> long established, recognized
! and consistently leaffairmed,
others continue to question
( their history, logic and efficacy.
Such contentions, in the light
, of the consistent interpretation
, in cases of thia court, seem
entirely untenable and of value
only as academic exercises.
. . . Ths wholesome ""neu
trality” of which this court’s
cases speak thus stems from a
recognition of the teachings of
history that powerful sects or
groups might bring about a
fusion of governmental and
religious functions or a con
cept or dependency of one
upon the other to the end
that official support of the
State or Federal Government
would be placed behind the .
tenets of one or of all ortho- ,
doxies. This the establishment -
clause prohibits.
And a further reason for .
neutrality is found In the free t
exercise clause, which recog- ,
nizes the value of religious ,
training, teaching and observ- .
ance and, more particularly,
the right of every person to
freely choom his own course '
with reference thereto, free of
any compulsion from the State.
This the free exercim clause
guarantees.
Thus, as we have seen, the
two clauses may overlap. As
we have Indicated, the estab
lishment clauM has been di
rectly considered by this court
eight times in the past score of 1
years and, with only one jus- 1
tice dissenting on the point, 1
it has consistently held that 1
the clause withdrew all leg's- I
lative power respecting rellgous i
belief or the expression thereof, i
l
Purpose and Effeet
The test may be stated as i
follows: What is the purpose i
and the primary effect of the >
enactment? If either is the 1
advancement or inhibition of 1
religion then the enactment
exceeds the scope of legislative <
power as circumscribed by the
Constitution. i
That is to say that to with- ’
stand the strictures of the i
establishment clause there must i
be a secular legislative pur- i
pose and a primary effeet that
I
incur the risk of placing the (
whole tradition in jeopardy.”
The Right Rev. William F. i
Creighton. Episcopal bishop of 1
Washington, said the court’s '
ruling ""may well be a gain ,
rather than a loss,” and added: (
""It throws the responsibility I
for nurture in faith and for the 1
inculcation of faith directly 1
back upon our churches and
o>ir families. The question has (
already been raised in our dlo- (
cese as to whether a family j
that observes no time of oom- j
mon prayer or Bible reading in (
its own life has any basis for i
complaining of the omission of (
them practices in the public i
schools ”
Bishop Creighton declared i
that the court’s ruling that the ]
study of religion, “when pre
sented objectively as part of a I
secular program of education,” |
is consistent with the First 1
Amendment, “clearly opens the i
door tor an increased emphasis (
upon our religious heritage as I
a regular part of the public I
school curriculum."" i
without a study of comparative
religion or the history of re
ligion and its relationship to
the advancement of civilisa
tion,” he said.
The use of the Bible or
Lord's Prayer in dally opening
exercise*. Justice Clark said,
was a different thing. Because
there were religious exercises,
he said, they could not stand
under ths Constitution,
Establishment Clause
It was the Establishment
Clause rather than the Free
Exercise Clause of the First
Amendment that figured In
yesterday'* case*. This is the
■ection which bar* State* from
advancing or Inhibiting reli
gion.
Justice Brennan. In a 77*
page concurring opinion, went
beyond the majority opinion
delivered by Justice Clark to
discuss other area* of church
state relations where ques
tions might be raised.
In both opinions—as well as
in other opinions in th* Bible
and Lord’s Prayer case* de
cided yesterday—the Justices
seemed to be trying to avoid
being misinterpreted a* strik
ing down other types of prac
tices.
Last spring, when the
tribunal struck down New
York’s 22-word ‘‘official”
school prayer written by State
educator*, the court was criti
cised on the mistaken ground
it had attacked religion gen
erally.
It wu along this line of!
i neither advances nor inhibits
I religion.
The tree exercise clause, like
i wise considered many times
> hero, withdraws from leglsla
i tive power, State and Federal,
the exertion of any restraint on
the free exercise of religion.
Its purpoM is to secure rollg
i lous liberty in the individual by
■ prohibiting any invasions
thereof by civil authority.
1 Hence it 1s neoessary in a free
1 exercise case for one to show
' the coercive effect of the enact
ment as it operates against him
■ in the practice of his religion.
1 The distinction between the
two clauses Is apparent—a vlo
-1 latlon of the free exercise
clauM is predicted on coercion
' while the establishment clause
violation need not be so
i attended.
I
Prescribed Exercises
Applying the establishment
clause principles to the cases at
bar we find that the States
are requiring the selection and
reading at the opening of the
school day of versea from the
Holy Bible and the recitation
of the Lord's Frayer by ths stu
dents in unison.
These exercises are prescribed
as part of the curricular ac
tivities of students who are re
quired by law to attend school.
They are held in the school
buildings under the supervision
and with the participation of
teachers employed in those
schools. . . .
Trial court . . . has found
that such an opening exercise
is a religious ceremony and was
intended by the State to be so.
We agree with the trial court's
finding is to the religious char
acter of the exercises. Given
that finding the exercises and
the law requiring them are in
violation of the establishment
clause.
There is no such specific find
ing as to the religious character
of the exercises in (the second
case) that the program is an
effort to extend Ito benefits to
all public school children with
out regard to their religious
belief. ...
Instrament of Religion
But even if Its purpoH Is not
strictly religious, it is sought
to be accomplished through
readings, without comment,
from the Bible. Surely the
place of the Bible as an instru
ment of religion cannot be
gainsaid, and the State’s rec
ognition of the pervading re
ligious character of the cere
mony is evident from the rule’s
specific permission of the alter
native use of the Catholic
Douay version as well as the
recent amendment permitting
non-attendance at the exer
cises.
None of these factors is con
sistent with the contention that 1
the Bible is here used either <
as an instrument for non
religious moral inspiration or
as a reference for the teach
ing of secular subjects. |
The conclusion follows that
in both cases the laws require
religious exercises and such ex- :
ereises are being conducted in I
direct violation of the righto of i
the appellees and petitioners, i
Nor are these required exer
cises mitigated by the fact that i
individual students may absent 1
themselves upon parental re- 1
quest, for that fact furnishes I
no defense to a claim of un- ’
constitutionality under the m- '
tabliahment clause.
Could Become Torrent
. . . Further, it is no defense !
to urge that the religious prac
tices here may be relatively
minor encroachments on the
First Amendment. The breach
of neutrality that la today a
trickling stream may all too
soon become a raging torrent
and. in the words of Madison,
""it is proper to take alarm at
the first experiment on our
liberties.” . . .
It is insisted that unless
these religious exercises are
permitted a “religion of secu
larism” Is established In the
schools. We agree of couroe
that the State may not estab
lish a ""religion of secularism""
in the wnse of affirmatively
opposing or showing hostility
clarification that Justice
Brennan discussed other
church-state areas in which
interest has been shown and
in which lack of understanding
might indicate the court had
ruled.
“Our decision in these case*
does not clearly forecast any
thing about the constitution
ality of other types of inter,
dependence between religious
and other public institutions,”
he stated
""I think a brief survey of
certain of there forms of ac
commodation will reveal that
th* First Amendment com
mands not hostility toward
religion, but only a strict neu
trality in matters of religion “
He Mid that nothing done
by the court question* th* pro
priety of certain tax deduetions
which incidentally benefit re*
ligiou* institutions and that
some activities now have lost
an original religious moaning.
“This rationale,"" h* Mid.
“suggests that the use of the
motto Tn God We Trust' on
currency, on documents and
public buildings and the like
may not offend the (MtabUsh
ment) clause.”

to religion, thus “preferring
thOM who believe in no re
ligion over then who believe.”
We do not agroaj however,
that thia decision in any sense
has that effect. In addition, it
might well ba said that one’s
education la not complete .with
out a study of comparative re
ligion or the history of religion
and Ito relationship to the ad
vancement of civilization. It
certainly may be said that the
Bible Is worthy of study for Ito
literary and historic qualities.
Study Approved
Nothing we have said here
indicates that such study of
the Bible or of religion when
promoted objectively as part of
a secular program of educa
tion, may not be effected con
sistent with the First Amend
ment. But the exercises here
do not fall into thorn categories.
They are religious exercises,
required by the States in viola
tion of the command of the
First Amendment that the Gov
ernment maintain strict neu
trality, neither aiding nor op
posing religion.
Finally, we cannot accept
that the concept of neutrality
which does not permit a State
to require a religious exercise
even with the consent of the
majority of those affected, col
lides with the majority’s right
to free exercim of religion.
While the free exercise clause
clearly prohibit* the urn of
State action to deny the rights
of free exercim to anyone, it
has never meant that a ma
jority could use the machinery
of the State to practice be
liefs. . . .
The place of religion in our
society is an exalted one,
achieved through a long tra
dition of reliance on the home,
the church and the Inviolable
citadel of the individual heart
and mind.
We have come to recognise
through bitter experience that
it is not within the power of
government to Invade the cit
adel, whether it* purpose or
effect be to aid or oppose, to
advance or retard.
In the relationship between
man and religion, the State la
firmly committed to a petition
of neutrality. Though the ap
plication of that rule requires
interpretation of a delicate sort,
the rule itself is clearly and
concisely stated in the word*
of the First Amendment.
School Boycott
Held in Boston
BOSTON. June II (AF)
Negro leaden termed the boy
cott of Boston's junior and sen
ior high schools a success today
and estimated that 3.000 Negro
students skipped classes in a
protest of alleged segregation
Negro leaders called for the
boycott, although they would
not term it a boycott, a* a re
buttal to what they termed “de
facto segregation” in the public
school*.
At St. Mark's social center,
across the street from Boston
Technical High School, an es
timated 250 junior and senior
high school students jammed
the building. The overflow
flooded into the street and
bums took students to the other
nine ""freedom eenters” where
special classes were held for
the Negro students.
Uniformed police maintained
tight vigilance at each of Tech's
six entrances.
Negro leaders—some of whom
rode in police prowl car* with
top police officials—said they
expected no violence.
O. Philip Bnowden, another
of the movement's directors
and the executive director of
a Boston settlement house. Mid
the entire protest is being car
ried out “in a most orderly
fashion.”.
The heart of the protest, it*
leader* Mid, la the demand that
the Boston school committee
publicly admit there is “de
facto” segregation, or Mgrega
tlon in actuality if not by law.
In Boston schools. This notion
has been rejected, 3-3, by the
school board.

Rights Witness Urges
Private Beach Exclusion
Private beaches, such as the 21 along the Chesapeake Bay
In Maryland, should be excluded from President Kennedy’s
bill to Integrate public service facilities, the Senate Com
merce Committee was told today.
Edgar 8. Kalb, who operates Beverly and Triton beaches,
submitted % polnt-by-point argument that the legislation would
be unfair to beach owners and)
managers as well as to their
nitrons.
♦ The administration bill
should require that services be
<men to all races if host busi
nessmen dealt in interstate
oammerce.
’Beach owners can’t tell if
those who pay to swim are>
from out of State, Mr. Kalb
said in his statement prepared!
fbr the hearing. Neither can
earners know if a ""substantial
number"" of rafts, boats, or
efther water equipment used
at the beaches has ""moved""
ift interstate commerce.
» Harassment Foreseen
•This confusion could subject
owners to harassment by the
unscrupulous who may chal
lenge them falsely. Mr. Kalb
claimed.
;He thought the bill would,
oast beach owners a court pro
dding to find out if they
must integrate racially under
provisions now Included in the
civil rights measure.
-Also, the committee was told
that the total miles of public
waterfront exceed the water
frontage of private beaches in
Maryland.
* Parents should have the
choice of sending their chll
£n to either ‘integrated or
regated beaches, according
Mr. Kalb.
.Denying families the right to
send their youngsters to pri
vate beaches, Mr. Kalb con
tended, would be the same as
denying parents the right to
send their children to private
schools if they “for personal
rlasons” don’t want youngsters
In public schools.
• Location of Beaches
Os the 21 private beaches, 14
mire in Anne Arundel County,!
rare in Baltimore County, and'
jLare located in Calvert Coun
ty 25 to 35 miles from the'
District.
About three Carrs and
Siarrow's in Anne Arundel and:
e Seagull in Calvert—are'
£lly integrated,"" Mr. Kalb's
tement said.

funs to move out of the moun
tains. it would be the end of
the Ba'ath Party in Iraq.”
■ Baghdad Claims Discounted
The government advance into
the Barzani tribal area and
capture of Piris Mountain in
June, much vaunted by Bagh
dad radio, amounted to noth
ing. Ahmed said. That area
had always been under govern
ment control, he said.
*“ln this first month since
the resumption of operations
against us. the rebel army has
net suffered a single military
defeat,” he declared.
-Ahmed accused the Iraqi
Army of turning its wrath on
defenseless civilians to make up
fqr its inability to come to
grips with rebel forces. He
claimed more than 100 villagers
were killed in the Berayi dis
trict. more than 200 were re
ported killed in Kirkuk and
SHleimanlya. and some 3,000
Kurdish town dwellers have
been rounded up as hostages.
""It the situation continues
as it is. we will be forced to
act against the oil installations
to deprive the government of
its most Important source of
revenue, which enables it to
maintain an army and keep it
supplied.” Ahmed said.

and Dutch Interests. It pro

ment by mob rule which now
prevails in many South Amer
ican countries.""
Mr. Bennett became the
third Southern witness to in- 1
Ject the charge of Communist
influences in the civil rights
fight.
His testimony brought a;
sharp protest from Senator
Monroney. Democrat of Okla
homa. against testimony re
flecting on Individuals on a
""guilt by association"" basis
Even in the days of the Mc-
Carthy committee. Senator
Monroney said, such charges
were usually reviewed in ex
ecutive session before they
were aired at public hearings
Senator Monroney recalled
that several witnesses had
brought up the name of the
Negro leader. Dr. Martin
Luther King. Jr„ on the basis
of a photograph In which he
appeared with a group at a
school In Tennessee in 1957
The school has been described
as a Communist training
school.
Goldwater Proposal
The Senator said he had read
wire service dispatches In
which Dr King explained
that he had merely made a
Labor Day speech at the school
In 1937. The Senator said Dr
about whether they operate in
interstate commerce was illus
trated by Mr. Kalb in a run
down of beach customers.
He estimated that on beaches
north and south of Baltimore,
less than one per cent of
patrons came from outside
| Maryland.
] This percentage of
! State customers could Jump
| from 30 to 70 per cent on
beaches in Anne Arundel and
Calvert Counties, he said.
Varying Application
“Under this situation, It is
possible that 11 of these local
private beaches would not have
to integrate and could con
tinue to operate on a segre
gated basis,” he said. ""The re
maining 10 beaches would
have to be integrated merely
because their particular loca
tions were more accessible to
out-of-State visitors.”
The civil rights bill excludes
private clubs. But is a private
beach a private club? Mr. Kalb
asked. He predicted that beach
: operators who ran clubs would
be ""at the mercy of persons
, with the power to instigate en
forcement litigation under the
:! bill.”
C. Maurice Weldemeyer, An
' napolls lawyer who is a member
: of the House of Delegates, also
testified this morning.
Delegate Testifies
He charged that colored peo
i pie of Cambridge, Md„ would
> not have conducted themselves
in a “vicious manner"" if they
had not been “engineered,
guided, inspired and financed
|by outside influences and
capital.""
! Mr. Weldemeyer suggested
! that the committee consider
I the use of commerce powers to
'stop agitators from crossing
State lines to incite riots.
Another scheduled witness,
Samuel P. Setta. a motel owner
on the Eastern Shore of Mary
land, said the bill would leave
him free to turn away disor
derly white customers but bar
him from refusing service to
1 Negroes.
of foreigners are employed in
its fields near Kirkuk in the
Kurdish area. The Kurds have
warned foreigners to leave.
Avoids Red Impression
""We don’t want to disturb
the oil companies."" Ahmed said.
""This is not because we are
their agents, but because we
do not want to give the impres
sion to the Western powers
that we are Communists.”
He strongly denied that the
Kurdish rebels get any help!
from the Soviet Union, whose (
propaganda organs champion!
the Kurdish cause and de- j
nounce the Iraqi government.
Asked to name the rebels'
greatest need. Ahmed quickly
replied, money. He stressed the
drawback of not having anti
tank and anti-aircraft weapons.
""If we had such weapons we
would control the cities as well
as the countryside and would
then be able to set up our own
autonomous region,” he de
clared.
Ahmed’s slight stature and
easygoing manner belle the
fact that he Is the organizing
genius of the rebellion. He al
ways wears the traditional
Kurdish dress of baggy, ankle
length pantaloons and vest
with a revolver at his waist.
Like all Kurds, he sports a
neatly cropped mustache. A
tuft of gray hair escapes over
his right ear from beneath his
multicolored skullcap. The cap
bears the embroidered words
| ""BIJI Kurdistan”—""Long Live
'Kurdistan”
King should be given an op
portunity to be heard by the
committee.
Benator Goldwater of Ari
zona, a leading prospect for
the Republican presidential
nomination, moved meanwhile
to broaden the administration's
civil rights program to cover
the rights of labor union
I members.
One amendment he offered
would enable the Attorney
General to file suits in behalf
of union members, seeking to
enforce rights granted them by
the Landrum-Orlffin law. Just
as he would file suits for
Negroes denied access to hotels,
restaurants or other public
, places.
A second amendment would
deny a union the right to be
the exclusive bargaining agent
with an employer If it arbi
-1 trarlly excludes from member
-1 ship any qualified workers who
wish to Join the union.
Senator Goldwater told the
Senate that civil rights seems
to be the crucial problem fac
ing Congress today
""If this be true . . , then I
feel we in the Senate have a
duty to examine all the areas
I where basic human rights are
being impaired or denied, ln-
I stead of devoting all of our
attention exclusively to one
I particular segment and ignor
ing the others,"" he said

patrols to gather at the drug
store.
Col. J. Maurice Tawes, who
has asssumed temporary com
mand while Brig. Gen. George
Gelsten attends the funeral of
his mother, arrived and was
told by Mr. Branche: i
""Since no one deems it '
necessary to resolve the situa- i
tion, the only thing we can <
do is to demonstrate.” 1
Emphasizing the military or- '
der against demonstrations. 1
Col. Tawes said:
“We’re not going to play cat j
and mouse with you. You must 1
make the decision, though I j
advise against it.” '
When the Negroes began to t
march in front of the store, the (
colonel ordered: ""Line 'em up, (
sergeant. Get an empty truck.” j
As soldiers led the demon- t
strators into trucks, they also
had to guard against an em- c
bittered crowd of about 2001
white onlookers, some of whom t
shouted “kill them” and “shoot t
them.”
The fourteen integrationists,
for security reasons, were taken
to the Naiional Guard Armory t
in Easton where they were de- i
tained without charges being i
lodged against them. <
Last night, between 400 and i
500 Negroes, infuriated by the i
arrests, gathered at the Bethel
Church. Most milled around
outside the church, while others
held a rally Inside.
Leaders Released
About 1:30 p.m. as the crowd
and soldiers were facing each
other in the street. Col. Tawes
arrived to report the Negro
leaders were being freed.
Reginald Robinson of the
Student Non-Violent Co-Ordi
nating Committee then several
times shouted. ""Our people are
being released, so we won't
march tonight.""
The Negroes shortly there
after began to disperse and a
! few minutes later their leaders
were returned to Cambridge.
Mrs. Richardson promptly
announced: “There will be
another demonstration tomor
row.”
There was no official expla
nation of the decision to release
her and her colleagues.
This morning, about 100 white
businessmen gathered at the
armory.
The businessmen walked sev
eral blocks througn the down
town section, their number
growing as they proceeded, but
the movement did not appear
' to be well organized.
They dispersed quickly before
soldiers were summoned and
six members went inside to talk
; to Col. Tawes.
There was no official expla
nation of the decision to release
1 the Negroes last night.
However, it was reported un
’ officially that doubt has ansen
' about the legal power of the
* Guard to enforce its decrees
* and that the leaders were freed
‘ because of uncertainty about
how to prosecute them.
The Governor's office said
today that Attorney General
. Thomas B. Finan Is preparing
, a memorandum to clarify the
Guard’s authority.
New Commission Named
As promised. Mayor Mowbray
last night established a bl
! racial commission composed of
! seven white and four colored
i members. The Negroes were
selected by the local protest
movement.
This will be the third such
i commission to grapple with
r racial problems here.
I After the Annapolis confer
ence, Oen. Gelston said that
’ anyone disregarding the ban on
. I demonstrations would be ar
rested and indicated that at
tempts would be made to ""put
! away"" repeated violators.
Because of the strife, the
I Cambridge Yacht Club has
i canceled two regattas scheduled
, July 30-21 and August 3-4.
After his return last night,
Mr. Branche reported that
i Marlon Brando, the actor,
'would arrive here Saturday to

Ervin's Long Testimony
Delays Robert Kennedy
By MIRIAM OTTENBERG
Star Staff Wrltar
The Senate Judiciary Com
mittee today presented a pre
view of things to come when
a Southern Senator replaced
Attorney General Robert F.
Kennedy as the first witness
on the administration’s civil
rights package.
Mr. Kennedy was waiting to
testify when Senator Ervin,
Democrat of North Carolina,
announced that he had several
hours of comments to make.
Other Senators, favorable to
the legislation, and obviously
anxious to get the Attorney
General before the committee,
had withdrawn statements they
planned to make.
Senator Ervin did not with
draw and Committee Chairman
Eastland of Mississippi ruled
that committee members had
the right to testfiy first.
Still Talking at Noon
The Attorney General re
turned to the Justice Depart
ment and Senator Ervin started
talking. He was still at it
when the noon bell rang and
told reporters that he prob
ably would continue tomorrow.
Senator Ervin began by say
ing it was about time that a
presentation was made to show
that the Attorney General was
""not altogether free from
error.""
He then argued that there
was no need for any more
legislation on voting rights
and that proposals to bar dis
crimination in places of public
accommodation were all un
constitutional.
Sees Laws Unused
In making his points, he
quoted liberally from various
Federal statutes, read a news
paper article, summarized the
Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution and dipped into
some North Carolina law books.
On voting, which is one of the
main sections of the civil rights
package. Senator Ervin said the
Justice Department is not using
the laws it has on the books
now.
In his little ""filibuster,” Sena
tor Ervin reviewed six statutes
in detail and said the adminis
tration proposals to expedite
voter registration were uncon
stitutional.
He contended that the Justice
Department wants to get final
Judgments on its allegations of
voter discrimination before a
case is tried and called that ""a
new suggestion as to how Jus
tice shall be administered in the
United States.""
3enator Ervin, warmed up
when he got to the principal
target of today's attack—the
administration proposal to bar
discrimination in places of pub
, lie accommodation affected by
i interstate commerce.
Violation Charged
I The administration proposal
1 is based on the Interstate com
merce clause of the Constitu
< tion buttressed by the Four
teenth Amendment guarantee
of equal protection of the laws.
Benator Ervin contended that
using either the commerce
clause or the Fourteenth
Amendment to attack discrimi
nation in public places violated
■ the Constitution,
i ""Anybody who thinks the

Supreme Court would uphold
the use of the Fourteenth
Amendment for this purpose j
has lost his confidence in the
ability, the intellectual honesty
and the integrity of the Bu
preme Court as it is now con
stituted.” the Senator declared.
As for using the commerce
clause, he said that the bill did i
not regulate commerce but
regulated individuals.
Statement Draws Laughs
Sen. Ervin said that if Con
gress could bar discrimination
in a restaurant because the
canned goods it uses move in
interstate commerce, then it
could also regulate domestic
affairs.
Amid laughter from the
crowded hearing room, he said
Congress, under this concept
could regulate marriage be
cause the bride's or groom's
wedding clothes had traveled
in interstate commerce, could
regulate birth because the dia
per pins crossed state lines
and could regulate death be
cause the coffins moved in
interstate commerce.
Warming up to what he
called ridiculous possibilities,
he said the operators of a
store would have to cross
examine every cusomer to find
out if he were an interstate
traveler and would have to
check the origin of the hot
dogs he served to find out
where they came from.
COMMUNISTS
Continued From Fare A-l
to racial, national and conti
nental lines.”
Some nationalist leaders in
newly independent countries
are Inciting their peoples
against the Soviet Union as
well as the West by “inculca
ting them with hostility toward
white people,” said Izvestla.
The Chinese attack on India
was aimed at the point where
the split occurs.
The Soviet government has
been trying to keep an open
door into neutralist India with
much publicized aid. It is a
sample of the use of economic
aid by which the Soviet gdv
ernment hopes to pursue the
Communist revolution without
risking nuclear war.
China argues that such aid
should go to Communist and
socialist countries already pur
suing the revolution against
capitalism.
The Chinese said the Soviet
aid to India played into Ameri
can hands by lightening the
Western burden.
An Indian weapons-seeklng
delegation left New Delhi by
plane for Moscow today to be
gin a three-week tour of the
Soviet Union and Czechoslo
vakia. Although the Soviet
Union has made no specific
promise of further arms aid,
Indian sources said Mr. Nehru’s
government hopes to obtain
aircraft, light tanks and other
items.
New York Jury
Indicts Four
As Red Spies
NEW YORK, July 18 <AP).—
A Federal grand Jury has in
dicted four persons on espio
nage charges and said Russia
spent “large sums of money""
on the spy operations.
The indictments were re
turned in Brooklyn yesterday
against a Russian employe of
the United Nations, his wife
and a mystery couple from
Washington.
They are accused of con
spiring for six years to send to
Russia, via short-wave radio,
secret information about United
States rocket pads, atomic arms
shipments, troop movements
and naval Installations.
The grand Jury also accused
the defendants of trying to en
list American military and civil
ian defense personnel as agents.
Held Without Ball
Indicted were Ivan D. Egorov,
41, a U. N. personnel officer;
his wife, Aleksandra, 39, and a
Washington couple known as
Robert K. and Joy Ann Baltch.
All have been held without bail.
The Baltches asked for and
were given a continuance until
Thursday for a hearing, on
their removal to New York.
United States Commissioner
Sam Wertleb granted the de
lay in Washington when their
lawyer, Edward Genn, 33, said
he wanted time to go over the
indictment with the couple.
The four were arrested on
July 2—the tgorovs here, and
the Baltchs in Washington.
The Egorovs appeared for ar
raignment on the indictment
today in the United States Dis
trie Cour in Brooklyn, but their
attorney won an adjournment
until August 20.
Another hearing was sched
uled for today in the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals in
Manhattan on Egonov's peti
tion for release on bail.
The Government said the
Baltchs took assumed names
and their real identities are
not known. At their arraign
ment, newsmen detected a
slight foreign accent in their
speech but could not identify it.
Radio Found
United States Attorney Jo
seph P. Hoey said a short
wave radio was found in the
Washington apartment of the
Baltchs.
Mr. Hoey declined to say
how much money the Soviet
Union spent on the spy opera
tion on the ground that such
information would be part of
the trial evidence.
The defendants could face
the death penalty.
Named as co-consplnatora,
but not as defendants, were
two Soviet diplomatic officials
who left tne country early in
May. The indictment accused
them of paying for and super
vising the activities of the de
fendants.
The two diplomats are Petr
E. Maslennikov, who was First
Secretary of the Russion U. N.

Os Training Program
* By PAUL HOPE
Star Staff Wrltar
Revision of the Federal man
power development and train
ing program to reach more of
the uneducated and more
young people, particularly Ne
groes, was urged today by
Labor Secretary Wirtz.
Mr. Wirtz said advances are
being made in breaking down
racial barriers in employment
but that this does not solve
the problem unless Jobs are
available.
“It becomes increasingly
clear there is no separation of
fair employment and full em
ployment,” the Secretary said.
""The prospect of fair employ
ment is frustrated if there are
no Jobs.”
Secretary Wirtz testified be
fore a Senate Labor subcom
mittee considering revision of
the year-old manpower train
ing program.
“Too High a Price”
Subcommittee Chairman
Clark, Democrat of Pennsyl
vania, opened the hearing with
a statement that racial dis
crimination and failure to train
youth adequately is the ""cause
of a very substantial share of
the national unemployment.""
“Hie Nation is paying far
too high a price for failing to
educate young people,"" Sena
tor Clark said. He added that
unemployment is twice as high
among “victims of discrimina
tion"" as it is among other
groups.
The major provisions of the
legislation before the subcom
mittee would eliminate a re
quirement that the States
match Federal funds for the
manpower training program
and would extend the program
to reach more young people
and illiterates.
Th changes would cost the
Federal Government an ad
ditional $361 million during the
Jnext two years.
Funds Not Matched
| • Mr. Wirtz said the States are
1 not meeting the matching fund
requirement and that, unless it
is eliminated, the program will
come to a standstill.
Mr. Wirtz said unemploy
ment has created a ""fuse that
is so much shorter than the
country realizes."" He said it is
a “very serious situation.”
j Most of the testimony and
Park free at
the Park-Sheraton
right in the heart
of New York City
This is practically unheard of. You'ra right in the middle of evarything
and you can park free (except for minimum rate single rooms). Yoer
kids stay free, too On room with adult). And In all guest rooms, froe TV
and air-conditioning. Plus the famous, entertaining Mermaid Room,
for reservations, call CO 5-2000
Park-Sheraton Hotel
. 56 Street and 7 Avenue, New York a
questioning dealt with the need
for reaching young people who
are entering the labor market
without adequate training.
Failure to complete a high
school education is committing
“economic suicide,” Secretary
Wirtz said.
Many Not Prepared
In the next 18 months, he
added, 5.5 million new yodng
workers will enter the labor
market, and 2 million of them
will not be adequately prepared
to get Jobs.
He said many applicants for
training under the Manpower
Development and Training Act
must'be turned down because
they cannot meet educational
requirements. As an example,
he said applicants for training
as cooks must be rejected if
they can't read menus.
Legislation being considered
by the subcommittee would pro
vide courses for educating ap
plicants to a point a here they
could take the actual training
program.

thorities viewed the rebel suc
cess as Portugal’s greatest
colonial setback since India’s
capture of the Portuguese en
clave of Goa hi 1961 against
little resistance.
Hit by African Block
Spanish officials in Madrid
expressed belief Portugal could
not defend Portuguese Guinea,
a territory about twice the size
of New Jersey, if Senegal and
another neighbor, Guinea,
moved against it in force.

Wirtz # at Hearing, Pledges
Support of Employment Law
By J. A. O’LEARY
Star Staff Writer
Labor Secretary Wirtz as
sured the Senate Commerce
Committee today that he will
support a fair employment
practice law as one step Con
gress should take in the field
of civil rights. He also indorsed
in principle one of the two
amendments offered by Sena
tor Goldwater, Republican of
Arizona, which would deprive
a union of the right to be ex
clusive bargaining agent if it
discriminates in the admission
of members to the union.
As to the second Goldwater
amendment, the Secretary did
not commit himself. That
amendment would authorize
the Attorney General to file
suits In behalf of individual
union members who have
grievances against their union
leaders, based on the Lan
drum-Griffin labor law.
Would Help Union Members
Mr. Wirtz siad there must be
some misunderstanding, be
cause Congress ommitted from
the Landrum-Griffin law any
reference to civil rglhts com
plaints.
When Senator Goldwater in
troduced his amendments, how
ever, he made it clear that he
wanted the Attorney General
to help union members enforce
whatever rights they have un
der the Landrum-Griffin Act
in the same way that the At
torney General would file suits
Involving racial discrimination
among customers in places of
public accommodation.
Senator Cotton, Republican
of New Hampshire, contended
that Congress would not be
passing a “whole bill” if it
merely prohibited an establish
ment from discriminating be
tween customers but left it
free to discriminate in hiring
employes.
Mr. Wirtz said that was a
very proper question, and would
be covered by a fair employ
ment practice bill, “which we
support.” He said the only
reason FEPC was not included
in the administration package
was because separate bills on
that subject were already pend
ing.
Senator Lausche, Democrat
of Ohio, also questioned Mr.
Wirtz on the question of treat
ing labor unions the same as
all others in eliminating dis
crimination.
Democratic Senator Harri
son Williams and Republican
Senator Case, both of New
Jersey, also testified today in
favor of a Federal public ac
commodations law.
In his prepared statement.
Secretary Wirtz contended that
elimination of segregation in
places of public accommoda
tion would stimulate the
ecomony and help relieve un
employment.
At their weekly news con
ference today, House Republi
can leader Haleck and Senate
Republican Leader Dirksen
said they have had no time
table from Democratic leaders
as to when civil rights will
reach the floor, or whether the
debate will start in the House
or Senate. Democratic leaders
have said privately, however,
THE EVENING STAR
Washington, D. C., Thursday, July It, 1963
they expect the House to act
first.
Senator Dirksen said he
hestiated to speculate about a
Senate filibuster, but added,
“unless all signs fall, this is
not going to slide through the
Senate very easily.""
Secretary Wirtz testified that
""inequality of opportunity and
the unrest it fosters hurts
employment.
“If Negroes felt as free to
travel and explore this country
as white families of similar

‘the economic stimulus would
be very large indeed in the
transportation, apparel, travel

Kennedy Backs Bills
President Kennedy told his
news conference yesterday he
wants both the civil rights bill
and his proposals for reducing
and revising taxes enacted this
year. The fight over the civil
rights measure Is regarded by
some members of Congress as
jeopardizing chances for pas
sage of a tax bill.
Mr. Kennedy also said he
thought it is “a convenient
scapegoat” to suggest that all
the country’s racial difficulties
are Communist- Inspired.
He was asked about conten
tions by Govs. George C. Wal
lace of Alabama and Ross
Barnett of Mississippi before
the Senate Commerce Com
mittee that Communists were
behind the integration demon
strations.
While Communists obviously
would try to worm their way
into any movement where there
is trouble, Mr. Kennedy said,
the Government has no evi
dence that any of the leaders
of the civil rights movements
in the United States are Com
munists, and no evidence that
the demonstrations are Com
munist-inspired.

Phony Civil Rights
Very few members on the Repub
lican side of the House can take pride
in their performance on the vocational
education bill. For the antidiscrimina
tion amendment which they offered was
politically motivated and threatened
the life of a much-needed piece of
legislation.
The amendment ostensibly was In
tended to guarantee that Negroes, hard
est hit In the present unemployment
pattern, would not be denied vocational
training in schools aided by Federal
funds. But there could not have been
a legislator in the House so naive as to
believe that this was the real purpose.
Actually, it was a transparent at
tempt to booby-trap the bill with a
condition the Senate would never buy.
The upshot was the strange spectacle
of liberal Democrats joining a Negro
member in arguing against a civil rights
proposal.
Before he voted against It, Rep
resentative Hawkins, a Negro freshman
member from California, said “the real
danger of this amendment is that it
will defeat the bill and deprive more
Negroes of needed training than even
Ivhltes.” That was because In the Deep
pouth and elsewhere, he said, white
people could go to private schools
Negroes could not afford.
As finally passed and sent unen
cumbered to the Senate, the bill prom
ises to strengthen job training by au
thorizing $450 million In Federal grants
over the next four years, in addition to
$57 million already available annually.
More adults and young people, such
as school dropouts, would be reached
through more schools teaching latest
job methods. It is a good bill. And
as to those sincerely concerned about
its fair application, they will have a
chance—at the proper time—to show
how they really stand on civil rights.
Mr. Hoover at 89
Herbert Clark Hoover today cele
brates his 89th birthday. We wish him
well and we wish to express our grati
tude for his many substantial contribu
tions to his country.
On the calendar one of these con
tributions consists of over half of a
long life given to public service, almost
entirely in the highest levels of our
national Government. But this record of
service, almost unparalleled in modem
American history, is much more signifi
cant than the simple weight of years.
As the passing of time clarifies our view
of the past, Herbert Hoover emerges
more and more as a key figure of our
era. In several important ways, he was
the first American in a position of power
to be aware of and to address himself
to basic problems that we think of as
typical of the immediate present and
the future.
First and foremost, he was an en
gineer. In his youth he practiced his
profession in China, meeting at first
hand, in the early years of this century,
the problem of industrial revolution
that will surely dominate the century’s
end. Long before World War I, he was
a confirmed internationalist, with bases
in San Francisco, New York and London
and operations in Russia, Australia,
Asia, the Americas and Europe. With the
outbreak of the great war, Herbert
Hoover, in conquered Belgium, became
the first of a new American breed, the
“relief administrator.” When America
entered the war, he returned home as
President Wilson’s food administrator.
At the war’s end he was back in Europe
providing the daily bread of people in
30 countries, and managing the rail
ways, waterways, ports and mines of
Eastern Europe.
His career in that time marked
the emergence of America as the sup
port and guide of the free world. That
his country repudiated that role be
tween the world wars in no way lessens
the importance of his pioneering work.
When, after World War n, we accepted
that responsibility again, we built on
foundations laid by Herbert Hoover.
To some extent it was as an engi
neer, the modern man, that Herbert
Hoover was elected our thirty-first
President in 1928. Four years later he
was bitterly rejected as the engineer
who had failed. By 1932 this shaken
Nation needed a scapegoat and Hoover
was the logical candidate.
For President Truman, Herbert
Hoover resumed his old task of feeding
the hungry in Europe and assisting in
the creation of new governments there.
But there was another engineer’s in
terest for which we are his debtors.
Since his earliest days in govern
ment, he had been fascinated and
appalled by the self-generative powers of
the bureaucracy and by the increasing
difficulty of getting anything done in
government. These problems have only
in the last two years commended them
selves to the serious attention of liberal
thought: Hoover was onto them decades
ago. For Truman and again for Elsen
hower, the ex-President conducted ex
haustive investigations of governmental
inertia and duplication. His hundreds
of specific recommendations were sec
onded by both Presidents and most were
put into practice.
The shadow of Herbert Hoover upon
this Nation’s history has proved to be
much longer than anyone imagined 30
years ago. Scholar, patriot, human!-
SATURDAY, AUGUST 10, 1963
tarian and insistent voice of the Ameri
can heritage, Herbert Clark Hoover, en
gineer, has built mightily for his coun
try’s good.
Madame Nhu's Tongue
Madame Ngo Dinh 'Nhu, sister-in
law of South Viet Nam’s President Diem,
is a remarkable woman. Petite, very
pretty, highly intelligent and articulate,
she is a political power in her own right
—but an exceedingly controversial one,
with an exceptionally sharp and rest
less tongue. Indeed, she seems congenit
ally disposed to say the sort of extrava
gant and outrageous things that tend
to increase, rather than abate, her coun
try’s internal tensions.
Thus, wholly apart from her efforts
to impose an absurdly unrealistic super
puritanical code of morals on South
Viet Nam, Madame Nhu, a devout Ro
man Catholic, has recently given voice
to tasteless and unjustifiably harsh at
tacks on the country’s Buddhists. These
attacks have been so extreme, in fact,
that her father, who is himself a Budd
hist and Ambassador to the United
States, has issued a statement—in be
half of the Diem government—disavow
ing her remarks as irresponsible and
showing a “lack of respect” for sincere
believers in Buddhism.
And now, on top of all this, the
irrepressible and ever-loquacious Ma
dame Nhu has got herself into hot water
with our State Department. She has
done so by declaring in an interview
with the New York Times that the
United States Embassy in Saigon has
“threatened and blackmailed” the Diem
government in an effort to “shut me
up.” Wisely enough, however, the de
partment has played it cool. Speaking
through Press Officer Richard I. Phil
lips, it has brushed her off with these
words: “We don’t wish to comment on
Madame Nhu’s utterances, especially in
view of the fact that she does not have
any official position in the Vietnamese
administration.”
This is the proper way to deal with
this strong-willed woman, who never
fights shy of publicity. Actually, in his
own relationship with her as his hostess,
bachelor President Diem may sometimes
have in mind, in a wry sense, the words
of Samuel Johnson: “I am very fond
of the company of ladies. I like their
beauty, I like their delicacy, I like their
vivacity, and I like their silence.” Or
he may occasionally recall the Old
Testament proverb: “It is better to dwell
in a corner of the house-top than with
a brawling woman in a wide house.”
The Art of Taxes
It is good that the House Ways and
Means Committee proposes to ease by a
little the tax lot of the author, actor and
athlete. In those professions and in
others, the road to solvency is not, as it
is for most of us, a slow and steady
uphill climb comparable to the grade
schedules of the Civil Service. Quite
often, in entertainment, sport and the
arts, solvency is achieved only by a kind
of financial “overkill.” One year the
actor is starving; the next he’s a mil
lionaire.
Until now our tax law has ignored
this difference in pattern. When an
artist or entertainer has “made it big,”
he is taxed in his new bracket just like
the top business executive who has been
in the bracket for years.
To most thoughtful people, this has
not been fair, nor has it represented ra
tional treatment of the talent that is a
natural resource we all benefit from.
Under the new proposals, the taxpayer
making more than a third more than
his average income of the previous four
years will be permitted to pay taxes as
if the high income had been earned over
five years.
The committee is to be especially
congratulated because the taxpayers
affected are notably without political
power, being the most highly individ
ualistic and unorganized group on the
rolls of Internal Revenue. The* new ar
rangement will be more in accord not
only with the financial facts of an
• athlete’s or an author’s life, but also
with the nature of the work itself.
The celebrated reply of the Amer
ican painter, James Whistler, applies as
well to the writing of a book or the per
fection of a talent for sinking long putts.
Asked how long it had taken him to
paint a picture, Whistler answered in
simple truth, “All my life.”
Sticky Enlistments
Some days it is hard to tell who
is sniffing the most glue, the kids or
the adults. Take that Navy officer who
is objecting to a District proposal to
control the sale of the sticky stuff.
He reasons that if kids don’t get
glue, they won’t build model airplanes,
and if they don’t build models, they
won’t enlist in the aviation services.
Apparently it doesn’t matter about
the boys who buy the glue for kicks
and, in the process, often suffer serious
health Injury.
Perhaps the theory is that, given
ample glue to sniff, a young man will
be woozy enough to walk into the
nearest recruiting office and give him
self up. But any recruiter who would
depend on glue to make his quotas must
have been sniffing the stuff himself.

'At Least It Got the Profumo Case Off the Front Page'
LETTERS TO THE STAR
Mass Transit
Gib Crockett is one of the
greatest. I have admired him
for years, particularly in view
of the fact that he usually
stays with the facts and
adroitly castigates deceit and
untruths.
So it is difficult to under
stand why he reversed thia
formula 100 per cent in his
cartoon on July 31, in which
he pictures the so-called
“highway lobby” rolling over
the “mass transit plan.”
Not one member of any in
dustry connected even re
motely with highways has
ever said a word against a
“mass transit plan."" In fact,
every member of the high
way-oriented industries have
gone on record as definitely
favoring a “mass transit
plan.""
There are several types of
“mass transit plans’* and
there is much controversy as
to which is the best “mass
transit plan” for the people
of the National Capital area.
The NCTA, in order to fur
ther its recommendations for
a railroad mass transit plan,
has endeavored to “sink the
highways.” It has asked the
taxpayers of our Metropoli
tan Area to give up over *6OO
million of highways and free
ways for which we have paid
and for which we are con
tinuing to pay under the Fed
eral Highway Act whether we
get these freeways or not.
Furthermore, NCTA has asked
us to dig down into our over
burdened taxpockets to fi
nance an additional *2 billion
railroad “mass transit” sys
tem. (*1 billion for cost; *1
billion for interest.)
Everyone in the mass trans
portation field knows that
rail mass transit was obso
leted in the teens and the
twenties from the point of
view of normal good business
economics. It just simply
cannot pay its way.
Conversely, bus mass
transit not only does pay its
way but puts back into the
In Defense of Congressional Staffing
A review by Star Staff
Writer Robert K. Walsh of
Prof. Kenneth Kofmehl’s re
cent book, “Professional
Staffs of Congress,” was read
into the Congressional Rec
ord on July 22, so comment
seems pertinent. Prof. Kof
mehl has indeed performed
an interesting task by study
ing in detail the operation of
the congressional committee
staffing system in its forma
tive years, after the Legis
lative Reorganization Act of
1946. However, both he and
your reviewer seem to have
Ignored several important
problems in the area of
minority staffing.
Prof. Kofmehl assumes
that the main function of
Congressmen is to act as
intimate agencies for their
constituents, and that, there
fore, the principal danger is
excessive staffing which will
lead to the overinstitutional
ization of members of Con
gress.
However, since Congress
men are delegates to a na
tional legislature, their func
tion is'to deal with national
problems in the national
interest as seen from their
districts, not to be mere
errand boys for those dis
tricts. It is true that histor
ically Congress has often
served in the latter capacity,
but now, in the mld-20th
century, with national prob
lems growing more and
more complex, our Nation
can no longer afford this
luxury, and the realization
is growing among Congress
men that if Congress is to
retain its constitutional role
in our governmental system,
it must equip itself to deal
more effectively with na
tional problems. This has
initiated a fresh Interest by
Congress in congressional
reform. It is scarcely be
lievable that a political sci
entist would wish to dis
courage this attempt at re
form and reconsign Congress
to a role it wrongly acquired
and is attempting to discard.
Minority staffing is only a
single facet, though an im
portant one. of the entire
problem of increased con
gressional staffing to equip
Congress to better fill its

Reds and Racialism
An editorial in The Star a
few days ago speculated
about possible Communist in
fluence in the racial equal
ity movement.
There are probably many
people who have privately
concluded that Communists
may be promoting and in
spiring the Negro activity to
some extent.
But, if this is true, isn’t it
all the more reason for
speeding up efforts to abol
ish discrimination?
And wouldn't it be wiser
quietly to take whatever
steps can be taken to elimi
nate, or reduce Communist
influence, rather than ad
vertise to the world that it
is Communists who are lead
ing the campaign to obtain
justice for Negroes in the
USA?
By the way, why are some
people bemoaning the fact
that the Negroes seem to have
a number of leaders, presum
ably representing different
viewpoints and attitudes
among them? Let’s not start
clamoring for one strong
leader who speaks for all
i Negroes. After all, we might
s get one.

proper, and in this age neces
sary, role.
Increased congressional
staffing, and especially mi
nority (presently Republican)
staffing, is imperative today
to correct a situation in com
parison with which the dan
ger of “overinstitutionaliza
tion” of Congressmen pales
into insignificance. The exec
utive branch today is this
country’s largest pressure
group. Every Federal depart
ment and agency is a lobby
with a vested interest in suc
cessfully acquiring new ap
propriations, continuing old
and initiating new programs.
Administrative staffs un
avoidably reflect this bias.
Especially when the Presi
dent and both branches of
Congress are controlled by
the same party; that is,
when the same party con
trols both the congres
sional and also the vast
resources of the administra
tive staff, it becomes impera
tive for the minority party in
Congress (now the Repub
licans) to have adequate staff
resources responsible to it, in
order to fulfill the obliga
tions of a responsible minor
ity party to the Nation —to be
informed, to criticize con
structively, to check the
Executive, and to propose
soundly-researched alterna
tive legislation.
To imply, as Prof. Kofmehl
does, that congressional
staffs can be nonpartisan,
simply Ignores political reality.
Obviously staff members will
have an allegiance to those
members of a committee (the
now Democratic majority)
who hire and fire, promote
and demote them, and have
first claim on their time.
Is not the proper function
of committees, as servants of
their House, to expose issues
I for full floor debate? If so,
partisanship is desirable as
an aid to full debate. Can
the minority perform any
constructive functions if it is
denied staff resources either
through partisan abuse or
through congressional un
derstating in general? If
not. the minority, and the
I committees in general, should
■ be provided with enough
staff to deal with the com
i plex issues of our times and
Fate of Fort Miles
The Rambler notes that,
despite a great deal of inter
est in Washington in the
fate of Assateague Island,
there has been much less
publicity in the Nation’s
Capital about a much nearer
ocean-front property that is
available for recreational
purposes.
His reference is to Fort
Miles, now declared surplus
to the needs of the Depart
ment of the Army. Fort
Miles, about 1,000 acres, is
just to the north of Reho
both Beach in Delaware, and
would be about 30 or 40 miles
closer to Washington and
other population centers than
Assateague Island. The 600
surplus acres seem to Include
almost three miles of ocean
beach and almost two miles
of bay front.
The Rambler is correct
about lack of publicity. In
the long battle over owner
ship of Assateague Island, I
do not recall mention of the
Fort Miles situation.
Unless compelling and
non-evident reasons exist, it
would seem nonsensical for
one agency of the Federal
Government (Department of
the Interior) to attempt the
costly process of condemning
property belonging to 3,200
property owners for public
recreation purposes, when
another agency of the same
Federal Government (De
partment of the Army) owns
comparable and surplus
property.

to act as a genuine check on
the executive branch. The
most disappointing aspect of
Prof. Kofmehl’s book is that
he does not answer these
questions. He does not even
ask them. He simply as
sumes them away.
We in the Congress who
have to operate the existing
system cannot do this, how
ever. We have to work with
a situation in the House and
Senate where Democrats
outnumber Republicans 3 to 2
and 3 to 1, yet staff respon
sible to the Democrats
outnumbers staff responsible
to the Republicans 10 to 1
and 11 to 1 respectively. We
see first-hand that this situ
ation injures both Congress
and the people, whom it rep
resents. To deal with the
problem we have formed the
House Republican Confer
ence Committee on Increased
Minority Staffing, whose
members are Congressmen
Thomas Curtis (Mo.),
Charles Goodell (N. Y.),
Robert Griffin (Mich ), John
Lindsay (N. Y.), John Rhodes
(Ariz.), Paul Schenck (Ohio),
John Anderson (Ill.), James
Cleveland (N. H ), Catherine
May (Wash.), Robert Mc-
Clory (Ill.), Albert Quie
(Minn.), and myself as
chairman; and the Joint Ad
Hoc Committee on Increased
Minority Staffing Including
Senator Hugh Scott (Pa.),
chairman; Congressman
Thomas Curtis (Mo.), vice
chairman; Senators Carl
Curtis (Nebr.), Winston
Prouty (Vt.), Congressmen
Glen Lipscomb (Calif.), and
myself. These committees
belie Prof. Kofmehl’s con
tention of intra-party cleav
ages. Their members come
from every part of the
country and represent the
i full liberal-conservative spec
, trum. But they are all Re
i publicans.
Minority staffing is not a
partisan issue. Republicans
i will not always be the minor
ity and Democrats the mi
' jority. It is, therefore,
strange that Democrats, who

G. O. P. Mid-Summer Madness
The Republican Party seems
to be going through a period 1
of mid-summer madness (
but there also seems to be a
method in this madness. And ;
that “method"" is to ellmi- i
nate Senator Barry Goldwater :
of Arizona as a possible suc
cessful contender for the

nation next year. At the
same time, it is to assure
control of the party, its
presidential nomination and
its 1964 party platform for
the liberals, the progressive
wing of the Republican Party
as against the conservative
wing. The question and it
is a seriotu one is whether
this battle for control will so
split the G. O. P. that, in

the White Home and the

with material gains in Con

and President Kennedy will be

will continue to dominate the

the Senator by declaring that
he feared the Arizonan would,
become the captive of the
“radical right” the John
Birch Society, etc. and by
calling on him to repudiate
the support of the “radical
right.” The New Yorker, when
Senator Goldwater’s only re
ply was to say that the Gov
ernor had finally announced
his own candidacy for the
presidential nomination,
reached out further in his
campaign to discard the Ari
zonan by virtually telling re
porters, in answer to ques
tions, that he might not sup
port Senator Goldwater if he
(Goldwater) were the party’s
candidate.
Party View of Rockefeller
The professionals in the
party organization regard
these moves by Gov. Rocke
feller as attempts to edge
Senator Goldwater off the
track. They believe he is act
ing in the hope, first, of win
ning the nomination himself,
and barring that, to be in
position to dictate the nomi
nation of another candidate
and also the party platform.
They do not see Gov. Rocke
feller as the possible leader
of another Roosevelt-1 ik e
Bull Moose Party if Senator
Goldwater should be the
nominee for President. But
he might sulk in his tent.
Whatever the Governor does,
if he fails to support Senator
Goldwater if he should be
the party nominee, these
professionals do not see him
as a possible choice for a
presidential nomination in
PEOPLE AND PROBLEMS
By RALPH McGILL
Civilizations Never Stand Still
As all but the more par
tisanly obtuse members of
the Senate have seen in con
sidering the nuclear test ban,
there is no evasion of the
central issue of our time.
The waters and the soil of
earth and the atmosphere
we breathe already are
poisoned. The degree of it
varies with geographic lo
cation, the passing of time
the blowing of winds, the
leaching effect of rains, and
the oxidation of materials.
All this has happened be
cause nuclear weapons have
been tested across much of
the past 10 years. These wea
pons quite literally can des
troy all life on earth.
The historian Toynbee
thought in the days of the
first atom bombs that in the
event of a war, perhaps the
central area of the African
jungle, where the pygmies
dwell, might be left relatively
untouched. But now we know
that strontium-90 is, in some
measure in the leaves of the
plants, the waters, and the
bones of the animals and the
people even there.
Test Ban a Symbol
This is why the modest
little test ban, which will
find the Soviets and the
United States agreeing not
to explode nuclear devices in
the atmosphere, is develop
ing so much hope. It is, to
be sure, but a small life raft
flung into troubled and
dreadful waters. But it is a
symbol. General de Gaulle
will, in time, agree to ac
cept the symbolism of it with
his signature. But how long
it will endure, or whether it
will expand or disintegrate
into war, none may say.
It was in August that the
the great powers went to war
in 1914. The 20th Century
was then but 14 years old—
an infant. Millions died in
that war, the first to be
mechanized with tanks- air
craft, new and terrible ma
chineguns, flame throwers,
and poison gas. We proceed
ed on, with the coming of
dictators to the second world
war. It introduced still more
marvelous
huge bombers, fast fighters,
flyl ig bombs, monstrous
tanks, and landing craft for
amphibious war. There also
was a new element gas
chambers. And into them
went millions of men, women
and children whose only sin
was that one of the dictators
thought they should be de-
1968. In their opinion the
Governor would be through.
The other move on the part
of the Republican liberals is
the recent creation of a ""Re
publican Critical Issues Coun
cil” an offspring of the
Republican Citizens group or
ganized at a meeting at
Hershey, Pa., with the bless
ing of former President
Dwight D. Eisenhower. This
Republican Citizens group, it
was announced, would help
organize the grass roots vot
ers, particularly independents
and disgruntled Democrats. It
would keep its hands off party
policies and the contest for
the presidential nomination.
Now comes the RCIC, whose
chairman is Dr. Milton Eisen
hower, the former President’s
brother, and membership of
which includes several for
mer cabinet officers in the
Eisenhower administration.
And it plans to write about
political Issues of the day.
What it writes will scarcely
be along conservative Re
publican lines, along lines
that Senator Goldwater be
lieves sound.
Council as an Irritant
Issues make themselves.
They are not made by a Re
publican Critical Issues Coun
cil, any more than they were
made by the now defunct
Democratic Advisory Council,
which functioned from No
vember, 1956, until Presi
dent Kennedy was nominated
in 1960. The Democratic Ad
visory Council was authorized
by the Executive Committee
of the Democratic National
Committee and appointed by
the then Democratic na
tional chairman, the late
Paul Butler. If it had any in
fluence on the Democratic
leadership in Congress and the
votes cast in the Senate and
House, it was not visible to
the naked eye. This new Re
publican Council has no con
nection with the party’s na
tional organization. It is not
received with cheers by the
Republican leadership in Con
gress. But it can be an irri
tant to the national commit
tee and to the Republicans
in Congress, who may think
that the money it uses could
be put to better campaign
purposes.
As for G. O. P. presidential
possibilities, some of the op
ponents of Senator Goldwater
have no love for Gov. Rocke
feller as a nominee. If neither
is the final selection, it could
be a Romney, a Scranton or
a Morton. There has been
talk of the G. O. P., in des
peration, turning to former
President Eisenhower, or to
former Vice President Nixon.
Gen. Eisenhower, under the
Twenty-second Amendment to
the Constitution, cannot be
elected President. That the
party will turn again to Mr.
Nixon, defeated for President
in 1960 and for Governor of
California in 1962, is just a
part of the mid-summer
madness.
stroyed so he could build a
super race of his own kind.
Now the 20th century is
63 years old, and we have
nuclear weapons and mis
siles that orbit the earth.
The testing of them is, as
i aforesaid, registered in the
■ bones of mankind, in ani
; mals, in the grasses, the
seas, rivers, earth and air.
Nor is that all. Already sci
i enlists talk of the possibility
1 of creating a vast, thick ra
. diocative blanket that could,
and would, hover over a
i whole continent, destroying
! all beneath it.
As the 20th century began'
the Krag rifle, the cumber
some Gatling gun, and horse
drawn field artillery were the
• most deadly weapons. Now
i the century is just past three
i score years. It is graying a
i bit, but in the ability to kill
i it is much more sophisti
cated.
What Weapons in 2,000?
The century has a mere 37
years to go before reaching
the year 2,000. If the pro
gression in science and
weapons continues as it has
since 1900, more especially in
. the past 20 years, what will
’ we have—and know how to
1 do—in 2,000?
s Presently it seems obvious
; that we shall have worked
i to develop test bans or will
■ have gone to war. In the ab-
• sence of war, new political
; alignment on a worldwide
scale will grow out of treaty
t negotiations.
! If we look back we see
■ that history never stays still,
i The political treaties in 1914
t died with the war. Kings and
; czars fell. New nations were
> born. The second world war
came. Out of it came various
> treaty organizations
■ NATO. SEATO, the Warsaw
r Pact, and so on. As the Chi-
• nese-Soviet gulf widens there
i will be treaty changes in Eu-
) rope and Asia. DeGaulle weak
ens NATO.
Civilizations never stand
, still. They go forward or
backward.

DRUG
Product Recalled
As Cataracts Appear
Continued From Page A-l
Clinic physician told Merrell
representatives were drug
induced.
5. The memorandum Itself,
circulated within FDA after
Merrell withdrew the drug from
the market. •
Letter to Kennedy
Among the information is a
letter to President Kennedy de
scribing how non-Oovernment
experts told FDA that the drug
should not be released.
Written in August. 1982, by
Dr. Laurance W. Kinsell, di
rector of the Institute for Me
tabolic Research in Oakland,
Calif., it said in part:
“A few years ago some of us
were asked by the Food and
Drug Administration as well
as by the Committee on Drugs
of the American Medical Asso
ciation for an opinion with re
gard to the drug triparanol
(MER/29). The chief question
was whether it should be re
leased for general clinical use
by physicians.
“I stated, in totally unequi
vocal terms, that I felt that
the drug should not be re
leased; that it was a potential
ly dangerous drug until proven
otherwise, and that for a long
time it should be used only
under the most carefully con
trolled conditions.
“Other ‘experts’ gave near
ly identical opinions.
“The Food and Drug people
chose to disregard this advice
and permitted the manufac
turer to make the drug avail
able for general clinical use.
As you are perhaps aware, the
drug was withdrawn from the
market within the last few
months because of disastrous
consequences attendant upon
its use.
“All of this could have been
avoided.”
The drug was released in
April, 1960.
Later, after reports of human
cataracts in users of MER'29
had been circulated, four re
searchers set out to see if this
could have been shown in ani
mals.
They found that in their
markers they vandalized. Justice of the Peace
Harold Hennessy, who imposed sentence, with
held the boys’ names.—AP Wirephoto.
after-the-fact tests, 34 of 38
test rats did indeed develop
“cataractous changes within 10
weeks after triparanol feeding
was started.""
Before FDA’s release of the
drug, the agency’s Division of
Pharmacology had also cited
“severe toxicity in some of the
animal testing,” according to
previously reported testimony
before the subcommittee, but
the division’s objections were
overridden.
390,0 M Used MER/29
An estimated 300,000 patients
used the drug. According to one
estimate to the subcommittee,
more than 1,000 persons' in
juries may be linked to it.
As side effects of the drug
were reported, members of the
FDA staff became convinced
the drug should be taken off
the market.
It took a long fight to get
the drug company to agree,
however. (Subsequent drug
legislation gives FDA more
power in getting such drugs off
the market.)
The Merrell Co. could argue,
in the case of the cataracts,
that these could have been
caused by other conditions,
some linked to aging.
According to an account for
the subcommittee by Dr. T. J.
Kirby of the Mayo Clinic, sev
eral cases of side effects had
been reported by the clinic to
Merrell and much correspond
ence went back and forth about
them.
Child Develops Cataracts
Then, on March 21, 1962, Dr.
Kirby said, cataracts were
found to have developed in a
6-year-old child, an unusual
case being treated with MER/
29 for high cholesterol and a
fat metabolism problem. The
clinic notified the Merrell Co.
A letter was later sent to the
firm detailing the case. A car
bon copy was sent to FDA.
Two company representatives
then went to the Mayo Clinic
and met with a physician who
had examined the child. The
doctor told them that he felt
the cataracts were drug-in
duced.
Fourteen days later, a phone
call from the Merrell Co. told
clinic personnel the drug was
being withdrawn from the
market.
Data Called Unreliable
Within a month, the confi
dential memo asking special
scrutiny of all additional mate
rial from the Merrell Co. was

It was from Dr. William H.
Kessenich, director of the Bu

Dr. Ralph Smith, now acting
director, and an official in
FDA’s division of veterinary
medicine.
All new material from the

should be sent for special treat

said.
“We have recently obtained
evidence that the William 6.

mitted as part of the New Drug

deration Counsel’s office said
as far as could be learned the'
Board of Cosmetology did not
ask for a legal opinion before
making its decision.
Commissioner Duncan indi
cated that if the Corporation
Counsel’s office rules that wig
salons are not covered by the
Cosmetology Act, he would in
cline toward licensing under
the General Licensing Act
rather than ask Congress to
broaden the Cosmetology Act.
Again, he emphasized the need
for action without delay.
Licensing Favored
The Washington Association
of Hairdressers and Cosmetol
ogists went on record last week
in favor of licensing of all per
sons “selling, cleaning, fitting
or retting wigs.”
Mrs. Helen Pollnger, presi
dent of the association, said
the association has prepared
a resolution for the Commis
sioners which notes that wig
sales have become a major
business here in the past six
months.
Noting that the sale of wigs
is not presently covered by
regulations such as those gov
erning the conduct of barbers
and cosmetologists, the resolu
tion charges that “the general
public, as a result, is unpro
tected from the lavish, un
ethical business practices foist
ed upon it.”
Action Proposed
The resolution proposes two
steps by the Commissioners:
First, an investigation by the
Commissioners looking toward
licensing and regulating the
conduct of all persons involved
in the wig business. Second,
amendment of the Cosmetology
Act to Include work on hair
goods of all types as well as
work upon the hair of any
person by any means.”

Attorney General and Rights Bill
Recognition That Measure Imperils
Program by Going Too Far Is Seen
Attorney General Kennedy
has just made a remarkable
statement to the House Judi
ciary Committee on the
whole subject of “civil
rights"" legislation. In a nut
shell, he recognizes that the
measure reported out by the
subcommittee, while desira
ble in Its objectives, goes too
far and might even Imperil
ultimate enactment of the
entire program.
In the course of his testi
mony. the Attorney General
suggested some ways to di
minish opposition to the bill.
He said, for instance, that it
would be unwise for the Fed
eral government to Interfere
In State, county and city
elections and that it should
confine itself to Federal elec
tions. But Mr. Kennedy’s
main objection was to the
wide sweep of authority
Which the pending bill would
give to the Federal govem
ment to regulate customer
relations in “public accom
modations.” He said the
principle behind the bill
—namely, that all forms of
racial discrimination are
equally objectionable—ls a
moral one, but that he be
lieves the original anti
discrimination p r op o s a 1,
which did not attempt to ex
tend Federal law to cover ev
ery form of “public accom
modations,” was a much bet
ter approach. Mr. Kennedy
feels that many of the prob
lems can be solved by volun
tary means. He declared:
“We were reluctant to ex
tend Federal power beyond
those areas where It was
clearly needed to meet exist
ing problems. The subcom
mittee has added to this cov
erage a catch-all which pro
hibits discrimination In any
business operating under
State or local ‘authorization,
permission, or license.’ This
addition meets none of the
criteria we thought Impor
tant.

MAX FREEDMAN
Common Sense on Wheat Deal
Excess Political Passion and False Tears
Found in U.S. Over Sale to Russia
Except In the United
States, it Is possible to dis
cuss trade with Russia in a
sensible way without creating
a political quarrel. Only here
does a simple commercial
transaction get entangled
with the fierce suspicions of
the cold war. This reaction
seems hardly worthy of com
mon sense of the American
people.
The sale of wheat and
flour to Russia does not open
up a vast new market to the
American farmer. Nor do the
present shortages in Russia
mark the failure of Soviet
agriculture. Mr. Maudllng,
the British chancellor of the
exchequer, has been much
more candid on this point
than has the Kennedy ad
ministration. He has ob
served that drought and
shortages are not uncommon
even in capitalist countries.
The Voice of America may
try to tell the Russian people
that the United States Is
selling wheat to the Soviet
Russians at Russia's request.
But for every Russian who
hears these broadcasts, there
are thousands of Russian cit
izens who have already heard
and read the Soviet an
nouncement that the United
States is making this sale In
order to reduce surplus Amer
ican supplies and storage
costs. The Voice of America
will be making a serious
blunder If It tries to convert
the wheat deal Into a propa
ganda war. It would be wise
to stay away from this silly
exercise altogether. The
wheat transaction must
stand or fall on its own mer
its.
Moreover, the Kennedy
administration cannot block
the sale of Russian wheat to
Cuba by anything said or
done in Washington. All that
can be done by this country
is to lay down conditions
t,hat American wheat will not
be shipped to Cuba. It is not
necessary for Russia to break
these conditions by dell
berate bad faith. A much
simpler course is open to her.
If Russia wants to help
Cuba, she can dip into her
own supply of grain or send
wheat to Cuba bought from
other countries.
Canada recognizes this fact
as one which she could
neither change nor control.
As a result there was no at
tempt in the Canadian sale
to bar all shipments to Cuba.
But a Canadian politician
can talk rationally about
Cuba without being burled
among a mountain of abuse.
No such freedom exists for
an American politician.
Various members of Con
gress have tried to attach
political conditions to the
American sale. They have
said, for example, that no
wheat should go to Russia
until Soviet troops leave
Cuba. This is not quite as
brazen a demand as Chancel
lor Adenauer's condition that
no American wheat be sold
unless the Berlin wall is re
moved. Dr. Adenauer im
posed no such conditions on
his own German government.
West Germany has already
ered by this provision are
unclear. It would seem to ex
tend Federal regulation to
law firms, medical partner
ships and clinics, private
schools, apartment houses,
insurance companies, banks,
and. potentially, to all busi
nesses which a State does
not affirmatively ban. And
Its application, If a narrower
Interpretation is proper, is In
any event uneven to the ex
tent that It depends upon
widely divergent State licens
ing practices to determine
its coverage.”
Mr. Kennedy pointed out
that, while excesses by the
police have occurred, the
proposed use of broad in
junctive power might create
new problems for the Federal
government. He said that be
fore the proposed section of
the pending bill could be
used, it would have to be
clear “that a Federally pro
tected right has been or is
about to be violate d."" He
contlnueu.
“It would be a mistake to
assume that all demonstra
tions are protected because
their alms are consistent
with national policy and are
supported by the vast major
ity of the American people—
like peaceful protests against
racial discrimination. Limita
tions may be constitutionally
imposed upon the time of
demonstrations, their dura
tion, their place and the
number of people. Not all
demonstrations are protected
by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. Thus, no mat
i ter how bitterly they may be
resented, not all offensive
police conduct In connection
with civil rights demonstra
tions would be within the
reach of Title HI.”
The Attorney General
spoke of the basic danger of
i relying on injunctions to
; control In advance the ac
tions of local police. He said:
“One result might be that
State and local authorities
sold large supplies of wheat
and flour to the Communist
countries and the Berlin wall
is still standing. Unlike Dr.
Adenauer, the critical Ameri
can Senators and Represen
tatives are not being hypo
critical In suggesting their
own political conditions.
They are merely being futile.
For their demands would
leave the situation In Cuba
absolutely unchanged while
American wheat would con
tinue to pile up In our stor
age blns. We would be left
holding both our conditions
and our wheal,.
Richard Nixon has com
pared the wheat sale with
the disastrous mistake of the
Cuba Invasion. If that Is to
be the measure of his wis
dom, It is a pity that he has
chosen to emerge from his
self-imposed retirement. Mr.
Nixon's hysteria finds no
echo In the prudent observa
tlons of Gen. Elsenhower
who thinks trade matters
can be discussed In quiet eco
nomic terms.
But many Americans ap
parently do not agree with
Gen. Eisenhower. They think
It Is sinful to feed the wicked
Russian Communists with
American wheat, even
though the Russians are

would abdicate their law
enforcement responsibilities,
thereby creating a vacuum in
authority which could be
filled only by Federal force.
This. In turn —If It is to be
faced squarely—would re
quire creation of a national
police force. This is a step
which Is historically, and
with good reason, abhorrent
to our Federal system. I am
sure all members of the com
mittee would be opposed to
such a drastic development
unless all means of dealing
with the underlying Injus
tices fail.”
The subcommittee has also
proposed the establishment
of a fair employment prac
tices commission and would
give wide authority to such a
body. But Inasmuch as a
measure of this kind would
have to regulate the opera
tions of labor unions. It is
apparent that the admin
istration sees trouble ahead.
The Attorney General said:
“At the same time, I recog
nize that there are some ex
perienced members of Con
gress who feel that the Inclu
sion of this provision in the
omnibus bill could make It
more dlffl cu 11 to secure a
rule from the Rules Commit
tee and could even jeopardize
ultimate passage of the om
nibus bill.”
Unquestionably, Mr. Ken
nedy is aware that opposition
to the bill has been mounting
and that this might mean Its
defeat. As a practical step,
therefore, he has been urging
that the provisions which
have raised most of the pro
test should be eliminated or
modified. This Is the custo
mary tactic In Congress In
trying to get legislation
enacted on a compromise ba
sis. But all the proponents of
the legislation, particularly
those who have been leading
street demonstrations, may
not understand the niceties
of legislative procedure.
That’s what sets up a real
dilemma for the administra
tion.
<© 1983. New York Herald Tribune. Ine.)
paying for it. If that argu
ment has any merit at all. It
means that the United States
should have a complete em
bargo on trade with Russia
as It now has with China. Or
It would make no sense to
forbid the sale of food to
Russia during Its period of
shortage while encouraging
more general trade with the
Soviet Union. We would be
able to persuade not a single
Industrial nation to join us
In this Russian boycott. Wo
would simply be giving our
own trading opportunities to
other nations, and would
hurt ourselves without Injur
ing Russia.
It Is a misfortune that the
Kennedy administration has
failed to present its case on
the wheat deal with the
frankness and lack of decep
tive rhetoric that marks its
explanation of the test-ban
treaty. The administration
has contributed to the bltter
ness and confusion of the
public debate by Its own
statements on this sale, with
their exaggerated and often
sentimental overtones. The
central truth is that the
wheat deal is not as Impor
tant as Its supporters claim
nor as bad as Its critics fear,
and It certainly can be ex
amined with less passion and
more common sense.

RICHARD WILSON
Doubts on Eisenhower's Stand
Impression of General*s Dissatisfaction
With Goldwater Seen in Statements
Gen Elsenhower, It Is
commonly said, could defeat
President Kennedy In 1964 if
he were constitutionally
qualified to run again. As
matters are now going, how
ever. Gen. Eisenhower may
play a part In re-electing Mr.
Kennedy, however much the
General would wish to do
otherwise.
For the former President Is
creating the Impression that
he is not now, and probably
will not be, heart and soul
for the most likely Republi
can presidential nominee In
1964. Os course, It is too ear
ly to say that Senator Gold
water will be nominated, but
political leaders seem to
agree that the present odds
favor It.
Unfortunately for Senator
Goldwater, the whole trend
of Gen. Eisenhower’s public
discussions in his effort to
help the Republican cause
serves chiefly to raise ques
tions about the Senator's
qualifications.
This Is a familiar condition
for those who have followed
Gen. Eisenhower’s political
career. A shadow of doubt
always fell upon his confi
dence In his once most likely
successor, Richard M. Nixon.
Whenever the former Presi
dent was questioned about
Mr. Nixon, what he said and
the way he said It was usual
ly subject to some shade of
adverse construction. The
words would not come out of
the General in a wholly con
vincing way.
In retrospect. It can be
seen that Gen. Eisenhower
wanted to get rid of Mr. Nix
on as the vice-presidential
nominee In 1956; it Is hard
to Interpret events In any
other way, whatever the
General may have said about
It, then or since. Not even In
1960, when it was clear that
Mr. Nixon would be the
Republican presidential
nominee, could Gen. Elsen
hower dispel the Impression
that he held secret reserva
tions.
This played a part In the

THE EVENING STAR
WatArwyton, D C, WodnoWoy, October 14, 1963
presidential election of 1960.
It was a mixed situation,
with Mr Nixon not wishing
to appear as a hand-picked
Eisenhower protege; and. on
the other hand, the question
was continually under dis
cussion of the depth of the
General’s support of Mr. Nix
on. The net effect was a Nix
on detachment from the
most popular Republican
President in history.
With his usual political
sensitivity, John F. Kennedy
understood this condition
and understands it now. Mr.
Kennedy comprehends that
however much Gen. Elsen
hower may profess his Repub
licanism. In the strict party
sense, the real role of the
General Is bipartisan He
could have been nominated
in 1952 as either a Republi
can or a Democrat, and he
was supported, and still is
supported, by both Republi
cans and Democrats.
Therefore, whenever the
former President speaks 111 of
him, Mr. Kennedy turns the
other cheek. Furthermore,
whenever he can do so in
good conscience, Mr. Kenne
dy identifies his interests
with the General’s.
Nothing would serve Mr.
Kennedy's political Interests
better than to have a linger
ing doubt hang over the elec
tion of 1964 on Gen. Eisen
hower’s confidence In the
Republican presidential
nominee.
And. it Is just the shadow
of this doubt which Gen. El
senhower is beginning to
create by his attitude on the
1964 nominee. For example,
why would he wish to discuss
In public, even hypothetical
ly, the far-out constitutional
question of whether he, as a
former two-term President
might run for Vice President
within the meaning of the
Twenty-second Amendment?
Such discussion inevitably
creates the impression that
the Republican presidential
nominee would be too weak
to win on his own. or unwor
thy of full confidence
What effect does Gen El
senhower s desire for fuller
exposition of Senator Gold
water’s views have except to
create the impression that he
is not satisfied? And later on
if he declares himself to be
satisfied, how convincing will
this be and what ways will
Mr. Kennedy find to remind
voters of Gen. Eisenhower's
one-time doubts?
This would all be very well,
and few politicians wou Id
quarrel with It. If the former
President s purpose were to
prevent the nomination of
Senator Goldwater But Gen.
Eisenhower says this Is not
his purpose.
And so, once again In that
beloved fuzzy way of his, Gen.
Eisenhower, the great bipar
tisan, Introduces elements of
doubt on where he really
stands politically.

THE UNITED NATIONS WANTS YOUR FIREARMS
Blueprint for Peace-A Threat to Gun Ownership?
Reprinted from August, 1963, Issue, Sports Afield Magazine
■
Read this startling revelation of the Blueprint for Sur render, the Plan to
turn over our Arms to a Communist Police State
t
of the proposed treaty, you don't know the half
of it. It is far worse than I've been able to reveal
in a few words.
The treaty outlines a three-phase disarmament
plan. All parties to the treaty would agree to do
away, for all practical purposes, with their entire
military forces and all armaments within a period
of something over six years. The only military
force, as such, remaining would exist only to be
placed at the disposal of the United Nations com
mand. This would be called a ""Peace Force."" As
the treaty puts it, 'oy the final stage of the plan:
Parties to the Treaty would complete the reduc
tion of their force levels, disband systems of re
serve forces, cause to be disbanded organizational
arrangements comprising and supporting their
national military establishment, and terminate the
employment of civilian personnel associated with
the foregoing."" There are vague provisions for
retaining armaments for forces which parties to
the treaty would be permitted to retain to main
tain internal order and protect the personal se
curity of their citizens. Dictator states don't dare
permit an armed citizenry. It is likely that the
administrators of the proposed treaty would per
mit United States citizens to have weapons?
Some members of Congress have since indicated
that this treaty does not include sporting weapons.
It doesn't mention sporting weapons specifically—
nor does it exclude them. It would be exceedingly
naive to expect specific mention of sporting wea
pons. However, if you read the treaty, you can
see that these can easily be included after the
treaty is put into force. But from that time on an
aroused American public won't mean much. The
treaty does refer to all armaments, with certain
exceptions for what is apparently a police force.
Subject to agreed requirements for non-nuclear
armaments of agreed types for national forces re
quired to maintain internal order and protect the
personal security of citizens, the Parties to the
Treaty would eliminate all armaments remaining
at their disposal at the end of Stage II.
told that sporting weapons are not included in the
treaty terms. Then try to get sporting weapons
(carefully defined) excluded and see how far you
get.
By VEJE BROWN
The Grim Facts About Disarmament
. i
Is the American Government about to sell the
Second Amendment (right to bear arms) for a
doubtful peace? Here are the grim, hidden facts—
Are the 30 million private American gun owners
a threat to peace and security in this country—or
the world?
Yes, under certain conditions this is entirely
possible. There is little doubt that this possibility
of a threat was fully intended by those states, of
the original 13, which insisted on adoption of the
first ten amendments to the United States consti
tution. We can be forever thankful that some of
the original states were very suspicious of un
bridled government power and demanded that
these amendments, later to be known as our Bill
of Rights, be passed as soon as possible after the
establishment of the government to be formed
under the Constitution.
Of course our response to the words ""peace"" and
security"" depends on our understanding of these
two terms. Peace and security do not mean the
same to all people. To the growing cult of mild
ness, peace means simply freedom trom the threat
of war. We can have this brand of peace any time
we seek it. All we have to do is surrender our
sovereignty and our capacity for self-defense, and
thereby throw ourselves on the mercy of the pow
ers that be. Security, to some people means being
taken care of from cradle to grave. These people
generally reason that an all-powerful Federal
Government is best qualified to take on this re
sponsibility. We can get this kind of security at
any time by merely surrendering our liberties.
Those who seek the power to impose their will on
the majority are only too happy to assume full
responsibility for the peace and security of others.
Naturally, those who relinquish their respons
ibility are expected to surrender their capacity to
disturb the ""peace."" Not too long ago we had an
offer to ""bury us,"" and I'm quite sure it was in
tended that this service be rendered entirely free
of charge.
The legislative attempts at outlawing guns can
be dealt with by an alert people, and wrong-way
legislation can be corrected; but there is an en
tirely new threat looming big in the form of a dis
armament treaty proposed by our government.
If accepted, it would leave us powerless to act.
The decisions relative to whether or not we can
have guns and the conditions under which we
will be permitted to use them—if at all—will not
even be made by our government. These decisions
will be made by representatives from various
countries, including enemy powers. It also appears
that we would have foreign inspectors in this
country to see that the conditions imposed on us
are enforced. Our only recourse as a nation will
be through the World Court. The World Court
consists of 15 judges, of which one may be an
American. The other 14 will be from various
countries, including enemy countries. Can we
expect them to be sympathetic to our cause? Does
this sound like a pretty package? It is not exag
geration. Unless you have studied the provisions
U. N. Peace Force' Would Rule World
Legion Probers Find Jokers
The Chas. M. DeBremond Post No. 28 of the
American Legion, Roswell, N. M., last year created
a Committee to examine the Arms Control and
Disarmament Act—Public Law 87-297. Its chair
man is James P. Risley, Lt. Gen. USMC (Ret).
The committee was set up at the time the U. S.
made its disarmament proposals at Geneva, based
on the State Department plan as submitted to the
United Nations by President Kennedy and out
lined in State Department publication No. 7277—
Freedom From War."" Its report states:
""The objectives of the Geneva proposals, to
which the U.S.S.R. must subscribe to put this law
into effect, is not disarmament but rather the arm
ing of the United Nations and the disarming of the
member nations. From the Communist point of
view, this is of supreme importance. They know
their superiority in political warfare, just as they
are fully aware of their irremedial inferiority in
military strength and capacity. Therefore, the
Communists are interested in seeing the United
States disarm, as much as possible, a soon as pos
sible, and as unilaterally as possible. We have
gone a long way to accommodate them.
""Actually, under the provisions of the law, we
could be disarmed completely before the U.S.S.R.
had a single reduction in unit strength, according
to State Department publication No. 7277.
Disarmament Equals Surrender
Our Bill of Rights will no longer have any
meaning—least of all the Second Amendment,
guaranteeing the right to keep and bear arms.
Surrender our military forces, our armament and
our sovereignty, and we are heading up a one
way, dead-end street. After all of the blood that
has been shed to gain and protect our freedoms,
why should we now offer them up on a silver
platter as a sort of sacrifice to the United Nations?
Do we have the right to subject future genera
tions to possible untold misery and possible en
slavement because we have destroyed their means
of protection?
Now, if ■ we disband our military forces, and
destroy all of our armament—except what we
turn over to the command of the ""Peace Force""—
who will then be the guardians of our liberties?
Perhaps this deserves looking into. The United
Nations Security Council directs the UN military
actions, and I presume that this will also be the
case with the UN ""Peace Force."" I wonder how
many people know, that since the beginning of
the United Nations, the Undersecretary for Poli
tical and Security Council Affairs has always
been a Russian?
1946 to 1949 Arkady S. Sobeloy—USSR

The arrangement was agreed to at a 1946 meet
ing in London of the Big Five. The Russian who
obtained the concession was why old Andrei
Vishinski. The American delegate who agreed
to it was the late Edward Stettinius.
All Firearms Covered — Even Yours
, Can you go hunting on a bright morning in 1984?
Can you keep a hand-gun for protection of your
home if you live in the country or in suburban
areas?
These are the questions asked by many Ameri
cans confronted by one word in the proposals put
forth by the U. S. Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency for adoption by other nations (with the
assumption, to foreigners at least, that such pro
posal has been approved by the people of the
United States).
That word is ""all.
It sets squarely in the phrase ""the elimination
from national arsenals of all
»»
armaments . . .
other than those required for a United Nations
Peace Force and for maintaining internal order
In other words, the soldiers and the policemen
and the criminals—may have guns, but free
men cannot.
» »
Efforts to weaken the National Guard and draw
it under federal control are a part of the pattern.
So is the drive for a federal law to require regis
tration of all personal firearms. It would make it
simple for an international army to keep down
resistance if the whereabouts of every gun in
America were known. It also would be
stitutional

uncon
if we have a Constitution left by
that time. The second article of the Bill of Rights
reads: A well-regulated Militia being necessary
to the security of a free State. We right of the
people to keep and bear arms shall not be i
fringed.""
• 9
We'll be
in
These are a few pieces of the pattern.
We are much closer to control by a world state
than most Americans dream.
The United States presented this treaty, refer
red to as an ""Outline of Basic Provisions of a
Treaty on General and Complete Disarmament in
a Peaceful World,"" at the 17-nation Disarmament
Conference in Geneva. Reports coming out of
Geneva would indicate that the negotiations are
concerned with nuclear weapons only, but this by
no means reflects the thinking behind the entire
disarmament picture as revealed in the treaty
proposed by our government.
The provisions of the treaty are found in a sel
dom-mentioned government publication ""Blue
print for the Peace Race — Outline of the Basic
Provisions of a Treaty on General and Complete
Disarmament in a Peaceful World."" It is United
States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
Publication 4, General Series 3, released in May
1962. It has been available from the Superinten
dent of Documents, U. S. Government Printing

Food Poisoning
People generally do not eat
foods that show visable spoil
age, but sometimes if the appear
ance or taste is nearly normal,
they take a chance rather than
throw the article away. On the
other hand, certain foods may
show no signs of spoilage and
yet be responsible for gastroin
testinal disturbances.
The most common type of food
poisoning is called ""staphylo
coccus"" and is probably respon
sible for about 90 per cent of the
outbreaks due to bacteria. The
organisms are commonly found
on the skin of a carrier or in
the throat. These organisms may
readily gain entrance to such
foods as cream puffs, cream-fil
led cakes, cooked ham, chicken
gravy, sausage, milk, cheese,
etc. If these foods are left at
room temperature for several
hours, the bacteria find ideal
conditions for multiplication and
for the bacteria growth to devel
op so as to withstand boiling
or cooking for 30 to F0 minutes.
The consumption of infected iood
causes the onset of illness gen
erally within two or three hours.
Tvnical symptoms include
naus
ea, vomiting, diarrhea, and ab
dom inal cramps. Although the
patient may b 0 extremely ill,
recovery is usually rapid.
A very different form of food
poisoning is botulism or botuli
nus poisoning. This type of pois
oning needs ideal conditions for
the bacteria to grow. If given
suitable food and if the air is
excluded, as in improperly seal
ed cans of meat or vegetables, it
will produce a very deadly exo
toxin, Frequently there are no
apparent signs that th P food is
not edible. The symptoms, usual
ly appearing within one or two
days, are notably different from
those of other forms of bacterial
food poisoning. There is little or

The botulinus toxin can '-be

boiling, a precaution that should
value after advanced symptoms
appear.
To avoid any type of food pois
oning
in the home there are
many steps the homemaker can
take in reducing the possibility
of it happening. Proper care of
foods that contain meat, egg and j
dairy products by refrigeration,
the bacteria will grow under
the ideal conditions of room tern
perature. During the holidays
or whenever a meat or poultry
product is prepared and served
with a bread-egg dressing the
two products should be separated
as soon as possible and each re
frigerated. When serving home
canned foods that are of low
acid content such as vegetables
and meats they should be cooked
to a boiling temperature and let
the food simmer for 10 to 15
minutes. Th e low acid vegetables
of beans, peas, beets, asparagus
and corn that have been pre
pared by home canning should
never be served in a non-cooked
salad. These are precautions that

. . . Examines
Second Amendment
By GEORGE KENNEDY
The second article of the
10 original amendments, the
Bill of Rights of the Con
stitution of the United
States, reads:
""A well regulated militia
being necessary to the se
curity of of a free State, the
right of the people to keep
and bear arms shall not be
infringed.
The term ""Bill of Rights”
and the provisions for the
right to bear arms come
from the English Bill of
Rights passed by Parlia
ment after the bloodless
revolution of 1688 which
placed William, the Duke of
Orange and his wife, Mary,
daughter of the deposed
James 11, on the throne.
The English bill of rights
was a limitation imposed by
Parliament over the power
of the monarchy.
In his final futile efforts
to preserve his authority,
James had asembled a force
of 20,000 men at Hounslow
Heath.
The maintenance of a
standing army In peacetime
became regarded as an in
strument of regal tyranny.
Along with trial by Jury
and indictment by grand
juries, the right to bear arms
was written into the revolu
tionary document.
This provision, a century
□lder than our constitu
tional amendment, did not
prevent Britain from be
coming an unarmed com
munity.
Recently a bank robber
was shot and killed by a
bank guard In England.
This was generally consid
ered unfortunate and the
Guardian asked why bank
guards were allowed to
carry pistols when the po
lice were not.
_o
MANY OF THE provisions
of our Bill of Rights con
cemipg freedom of religion,
freedom of speech and free
dom of Che press were sug
gested a^ l debated in the
oorlsotutlonal convention
in Philadelphia in 1887.
They were rejected be
cause. it was 1e44 that
denying certain powers
to the Federal Government
they were creating would
Imply that otherwise it
would have such power. The
Federal government was to
have no powers except those
enumerated in the doument.
When the Constitution
went to the States—it was
to go into effect when nine
of the 13 had ratified It—
it was understood that sug
gested amendments would
be considered by the Con
gress it was creating.
More than 200 amend
ments were suggested by
the State conventions. Many
suggested the same thing in
different words. The pro
visions had to do with reli
gion, right of petition, right
of assembly, right to bail.
These amendments were
all limitations on the power
of the Federal government,
not on the States. The prob
lem was not easy. Present
day shibboleths such as
“freedom of religion,” and
“separation of church and
State” would not get the
first Congress over the
the passes of Jordan.
o
TAKE THE WORDING of
the First Amendment:
“Congress shall make no
law restricting an establish
ment of religion or pro
hibiting the free exercise
thereof.”
Massachusetts had an es
tablished religion Con
gregationalism, which con
tinued until 1833. The Epis
copal Church in Maryland
to this day, in establlshling
a new parish, requests an
act of the legislature and
the legislature obliges.
It was James Madison,
“the Father of the Consti
tution,” who undertook to
please the States by having
Congress pass amendments.
This was in the first session
of Congress in 1789 in New
York City Hall.
As in recent legislation,
the first Congress wrote the
Second Amendment in con
ference.
The House version had a
provision to exempt
scientous objector from
bearing arms. The Senate
version did not have it, and
it was dropped by the con
ferees.
“Militia” at that time
meant that every able bodied
man should respond, with
fire arms, to the summons
of the States.
That’s how the Second
Amendment got into the
Constitution and there it is
today.
Army Unit OKs
High Dam Plan
For Seneca
8 Projects Win
Approval for
Potomac Basin
By LEE FLOR
Star Staff Writer
A key Army Engineers’ re
view board has recommended
construction of the controver
sial high dam and reservoir at
Seneca on the Potomac River.
The Seneca recommenda
tions were part of a proposal
for eight major reservoirs, esti
mated to cost 3242 million, on
the Potomac River and its tri
butaries.
The recommendations call
for complete Congressional au
thorization for about half of a
SSOO million, 18-reservoir Poto
mac Basin plan recommended
last April, and ask for limited
congressional approval for
more study for the last half of
the basin plan.
The review board, the Board
of Engineers for Rivers and
Harbors of the Army Corps of
Engineers, made its recommen
dations yesterday to Lt. Gen.
W. K. Wilson, chief of the
Corps Engineers.
To Study Alternative
The Seneca recommenda
tions call for careful study of
an alternative for more elab
orate sewage treatment and
distillation of water, together
with possible use of water from
the Potomac estuary south of
Washington.
The Seneca dam and reser
voir, estimated to cost sll7
million, or over half the cost of
the ""bobtailed” basin plan, is
not recommended for comple
tion until 1977. However, ad
vance acquisition of the site
may be authorized by Congress,
and this may start within a
few years.
The next step in the ela
borate process required for ap
proval of the basin plan is for
Gen. Wilson and his staff to
complete a preliminary report
to Congress.
This may be completed with
in three months The prelimi
nary report automatically, un
der Federal legislation, goes for
review to the District Commis
sloners, the Governors of
Maryland. Virginia, Pennsyl
vania ond West Virginia, and
to key Federal agencies.
©•er Dams in Plan
The other major reservoirs,
estimated cost, and the pro
posed completion date for con- :
struction, are as follows:
Royal Glen, W. Va., $32.3
million. 1968; Chambersburg.
Pa., $134 million, 1969; Staun
ton. Va., S2O million. 1970; Six
Bridge. Md.. $15.5 million, ,
1971; West Branch. Pa. $13.8
million, 1972; Brocks Gap, Va., ,
$134 million, 1973; Winchester,
Va., sl2 million, 1974.
A ninth major reservoir, at
Bloomington on the boundary
between Maryland and West
Virginia, already has been au
thorized. It has a tentative
completion date of 1965.
The Seneca Dam has been
heavily opposed in the Wash
ington area because it would
need about 44,000 acres of land
in Maryland and Virginia. It ’
also would flood portions of the
historic Chesapeake dt Ohio
Canal,
THE JEFFERSON PLAN
Discussions Play an Important Part in Social Studies
< By THOMAS F. DIMOND
Star Stiff Writer
The trouble with the British
in the Revolutionary War was
that they were too confident.
“Instead of crushing all our
forces at once they went slow
ly,” an eighth-grade boy re
marked to his class at Jeffer
son Junior High.
This touched off a remark by
another boy. “One example of
this was in Philadelphia, where
the British spent a whole -year
dancing and having balls and
giving dinner parties,” he said.
""The Americans were roughing
it out at Valley Forge.”
Some students in the Ameri
can history course Uttered at
the way the second youngster
embellished the facts. Then
other students added new
points to the theme of the dis
cussion, advantages and disad
vantages to both sides in the
war.
Discussions Important
Discussions like this are an
important part of social studies
at Jefferson. The whole class
may talk about the same topic,
as it did on this particular day,
or it may break into groups
and meet in several rooms to
attack different problems.
During these sessions, one
student is selected as chairman
and another as reporter to take
back the main points to the
whole class. The chairman’s
job is to lead the dialogue and
see that everyone participates.
At times these conferences
are called seminars and the
participants—five to seven to a

The cause of the two-alarm
blaze at 1221 New Jersey
avenue N.W. was still unde

fire officials were also trying
to find out how the fire en

before it was reported.
All three victims were
trapped in a top-floor flat

The content of the social

other junior highs, where world
history is an elective, the
course moves from the cave

At Gordon Junior High in
late October, the ninth-grade

early civilization around the
Aegean Sea and was working
with maps in its study of Crete

Lt. Lynch said the landlady.
Mrs. Cora Boone, 73, and a

Mrs. Boone's room shortly after
6 p.m. The two women said
they ran up to the second and

Minutes later, the fire from
the landlady’s room spread up
the wood stairway, blocking the
only escape route. Lt. Lynch
said. The old row-house type
building has no fire escape, the

Apparently the fire burned

the Children's Hospital for a year, now plans to move to a
site next to the hospital and give up its location at <123
Nebraska avenue N.W.
The center, founded by Dolley Madison as the Washington
City Orphan Asylum after the War of 1812. now provides
psychiatric services to children.
Its new building, according
to plans reported yesterday at
a board meeting of the hos
pital, would be built near the
hospital. It would be com
pleted about the fall of 1965
at a cost of about $1.5 to $2
million.
Probable site for the new
Hillcrest Children’s Center
building is on W street between
Thirteenth and Fourteenth
streets N.W., it was learned
today. This site would mean
the sale and destruction of the
Capitol (formerly Turner’s!
Arena, now used for televised
wrestling.
Sale Considered
Spokesmen for Hillcrest said
they could not reveal the site
and would not confirm that
the arena may go. But an
employe of the arena con
firmed that sale is being con
sidered.
The Hillcrest Center would
retain its present name. Like
the other affiliates of the hos
pital—the Hearing and Speech
Center and the Well Baby
Clinic—it may eventually be
come part of an over-all chil
dren’s medical center.
Dr. Robert H. Parrott, the
hospital’s medical director, said
today that a long-range plan or
""hope” is for a medical center
in a park like area at the pres
ent site at 2125 Thirteenth
street N.W.
He said this long-range plan
may be boosted by possible re
development of the area.
Eligible for Renewal
Dr. Parrott said the homes
around the hospital have been
studied as part of the How
ard University study area by a
consulting firm for the Na
tional Capital Planning Com
mission for urban renewal sea-
I sibillty.
He said the area was con
sidered eligible for renewal by
the consultants.
Rudolph Kauffmann 11,
president of the hospital, re
ported a deficit for the past
year yesterday of $398,056.
The hospital has operated at
a deficit for four of the last five
years. In the 12 months ending
October 31, the hospital pro-

Elsewhere, themes are de
emphasized, according to a
Gordon teacher. “In history it
has been the practice to follow
broad trends, but there is a
tendency now to emphasize
specific events and dates.” said
Mrs. Iris Metz, who teaches
American history and English
at Gordon.
Faith Borne Out
In fashioning the social stu
dies curriculum. Jefferson has
taken Into account the geogra
phy and history which str dents
had in the fourth, fifth and
sixth grades. <On one occasion
I found this faith borne out. A
girl said she bad used her
sixth-grade notes to prepare
for an eighth-grade history dis
cussion.)
Thus geography at Jefferson
has little time allotted to the
physical characteristics of the
United States, since this should
have been covered in elementa
ry school.
Instead, it concentrates on
agriculture, natural resources
and commerce of the United
States and relates them too
each other. The climates, land
forms and populations of other
nations also receive more at
t j tention.
James F. Murray, the teach
, er, attempts to show connec
s tlons between these. After the
i class studies manufacturing in

s related to trade, which in turn

Kauffmann reported.
Private contributions in re

A spokesman for the hospital
said today that a subcommittee
' of the hospital board is now

-1 pital's long policy of accepting

Hillcrest s present site and

major part of the cost of the

Woman, 63,
Killed by Car
In Arlington
A 63-year-old woman was
struck and killed today in an
accident Involving a car driven
by Arlington State Senator
Charles R. Fenwick.
Police said they were un
certain whether a truck might
■ have struck the woman beforel
■ she was hit by a car operated
i by Senator Fenwick.
The victim, identified by
1 police as Ruth Ramsey of the
• 4700 block of Old Dominion
drive, was pronounced dead on
arrival at Arlington Hospital
after the accident on Lee high-'
, way near North Wayne street. !
“There is no question that'
Senator Fenwick's car hit the
woman, but there is a question
’ of whether he hit her first.”
_ said Arlington Commonwealth’s
I Attorney William J. Hassan
_ Mr. Hassan has ordered an
autopsy.
According to police Capt.
j Dudley Rector, the woman, who
_' lived with her sister, was walk
, ing toward Washington on the
south (sidei of Lee highway at
about 6:54 am. near North
, Wayne street.
, Capt Rector said a woman
' who lives in the house over
looking the scene between
North Wayne and Veitch street I
said she heard a commotion, 5
looked out the window and
saw a white truck pass. A po
lice lookout has been broad
cast for the truck.
Senator Fenwick told police
i that he did not see the woman.
, but heard a thump and im
mediately stopped. He said
; he went back to the woman,
( who was lying In the street,
police reported.
. Senator Fenwick told police
1 there was a dent in the right
front fender of his car which
■ he cannot explain.
Mr. Hassan said a hearing
t would be held, probably latei
■ this month. No charges have
been filed, Mr. Hassan said.
will lead to a discussion of the
Common Market and its effect
on the American producer.
Geography at Gordon is pri
marily a study of the physio
graphy, climate, manufacturing
and farming of the United
States, but because of the large
number of foreign students at
the school. Mrs. Sylvia Bouton
holds ""Embassy Day"" for her
students every other week.
This gives her an opportuni
ty to cover the characteristics
of 15 foreign nations during
the year, among them Ghana.
Yugoslavia, France and Great
Britain.
Mrs. Bouton, like most. Gor
don teachers, checks her pu
pils’ reading habits by frequent
questions which are framed to
carry the subject matter for
ward and elicit some thought.
But sometimes children con
centrate too much on being
first with an answer.
“Where is Ghana?” Mrs
Bouton asked, and a student
placed It on the west coast of
Africa.
Answer Is Correct
""From your study of maps, it
is north of what?"" she contin
ued. and the correct answer,
the equator, was given.
“From your study of latitude
and longitude, what would you
expect the climate to be?""
At this point a student’s
hand went up.
""Dry and wet,” he said.
Tomorrow: Science—how much
lab work?
Measure Plans
Protection for
D. C. Investors
A bill aimed to protect Wash
ington investors from inept or
unscrupulous security dealers
was reported out today by a
House District subcommittee.
Under the legislation, the
brokerage firms and salesmen
would be controlled through
licensing, bonding and capital
ization regulations.
The subcommittee, headed
by Representative Abernethy.
Democrat of Mississippi, held
hearings earlier this year on
the proposed protective meas
ures.
The subcommittee's action
today was to approve a bill
introduced by Representative
Springer. Republican of Illi
nois. but with several amend
ments.
The legislation now goes be
fore the full House District
Committee. The bill gives
jurisdiction over the invest
ment firms to the District Pub
lic Utilities Commission This
agency's name would be
changed to the Public Service
Commission.
Key Provisions
Key protection controls car
ried in the subcommittee bill
include:
Licensing of local brokerage
houses and their salesmen: a
bonding requirement of $25.-
000 for the firms rthe Spring
er bill had proposed that the
bond be $50.0001; and require
ment that the investment
firms maintain a minimum
capitalization of $25,000. The
bill as introduced provided for
a minimum capital require
ment of $15,000.
The legislation carries pro
visions for denying, suspend
ing and revoking permits
Mr. Springer introduced his
bill after The Star's ""Investors
Beware"" series last year
spelled out the need for local
controls to protect the public
from unqualified or shady
I brokerage firms.
Almost all of the States
have some type of local securl
ties-control legislation on
their statute books.
Loopholes Now Present
i Sponsors of the bill have
stated that Federal laws at
I present do not give investors
j the protection that can be pro
vided through local regula
j tions.
The subcommittee today
wrote in an amendment aimed
at erasing the jurisdictional
question over which agency
should control the activities of
salesmen who handle both con
ventional life insurance policies
and variable annunity policies,
which are similar to mutual
fund securities.
The subcommittee decided on
dual jurisdiction, with insur
ance men continuing to report
to the District s insurance of
fice on conventional policies
and to the new Public Service
Commission on variable an
nuity policy matters.
The subcommittee today cut
back from two years to one
year the length of time that
the licenses would run before
being subject to renewal.
2 Sailors 'Dive'
Tonight to Test
Synthetic Air
Two sailors will climb into
a decompression chamber at
the Washington Navy Yard
tonight and stay there until
9 am. Friday.
They will be testing how
much time is needed for divers
to return to the surface safely
after living 300 feet below sea
level, the Navy says.
The Navy Yard’s Experi
mental Diving Unit is trying
to develop new decompression
rate tables for breathing a
synthetic atmosphere of 95
per cent helium and 5 per
cent oxygen under deep sea
pressure.
The Navy says the mixture
may be the best for men who
spend long periods in stations

... Visits New
NRA Building
By GEORGE KENNEDY
The ""National Rifle Asso
ciation” is a sign familiar to
all those who have gone up
or down Sixteenth street.
It was an old gothic man
sion at the southwest corner
of Bcott circle.
In the last few years a
modem office building has
been erected to house the
NRA.
The National Rifle Asso
ciation is an organization
dedicated to the Second
Amendment. of the Constitu
tion, that “the right of the
people to keep and bear arms
shall not be infringed.”
Its members feel the Sec
ond Amendment’s position in
our Bill of Rights, is proper—
lust after the First Amend
ment’s rights of freedom of
religion, speech an press.
NRA’s official publication
IB “The American Rifleman.”
Lee Harvey Oswald
responded to an ad in its
February edition.
He purchased from a
Chicago mail order house a
surplus Italian 6.5 mm. bolt
action carbine advertised at
(16.88: with telescope sight
(19.95. One hundred rounds
)f ammunition were offered
(six shot clip free) at 87.50.
This was the gun that
tilled President Kennedy.
Mail order ads are keyed,

riven as the address of the
advertiser also denotes the
publication.
o
WHEN I CALLED at the
SRA yesterday. Jack Basil of
*s public relations office
suggested I talk to Frank C.
Daniel, Jr., the executive
secretary.
Mr. Daniel, a moderately
sail man with thinning dark
lair, dark necktie, dark suit,
yas not on the defensive.
After drawing him out on
a history of the organization,
„ a very Interesting story, I
asked about the fatal ad.
“It’s quite possible it was

IChicago mail order house)
appeared in several hunting
nagazines.
“We are thankful that Os
wald was not a member of
NRA,” Mr. Basil interrupted.
“President Kennedy was,”
he said, and handed over a
reproduction of a letter from
him sending greetings to the
NRA on the occasion of its
)2d annual meeting.
“The National Rifle Asso
•lation was started in New
Fork in 1871, a few years
after the Civil War,” Mr.
Daniel said.
“Officers of the
volunteer Regiment, now the
National Guard were dis
turbed because the aid
frontier skill of handling *
rifle was passing.
“Competition in marks
manship on rifle ranges grew.
It became an important
sport. Communities took
pride in their rifle teams.
International competition in
creased interest.
o
“THE IDEA was and is that
the manhood of the Nation
of military age should know
how to shoot.
""Early in this century Eliiru
Root, President Theodore
Roosevelt’s Secretary of War,
created the Army General
staff.” ■;
• “He also was responsible
for that part of the'National
Defense Act setting up a
position of Director of Civil
ian Marksmanship.
“The DCM has offices in
the old post office building.
He has no official connection
with this association, but we
work very closely together..
“This is not a trade asso
ciation. The trade association
is the Sporting Anns and
Ammunition Manufacturers
Institute in New York com
monly called ‘Saami.’
“People think we are a
trade association because we
have a big building, they
can’t understand so many
people being so enthusiastic
about firearms.
“We have 600,000 members
in 11,000 rifle clubs in the
United States.
“We have no corporation
memberships, all are individ
uals or rifle clubs.
“We have co-operated with
Senator Dodd’s committee in
the drafting of new legisla
tion for firearms control.
“T h e assassination has
caused the Senator to make
important changes in his bill.
Department of Justice wants
to substitute legislation that
would restrict manufacturers
to shipping guns to licensed
dealers, not to individuals.
“Our executive committee,
30 members and manufactur
ers, will met this week end to
determine the association’s

THE JEFFERSON PLAN
Pupils Studying Mathematics Now Learn Theory, Too
By THOMAS F. DIMOND I
Star SUH Writer I
Do you know the difference
between a number and a num
eral? ,■,
Probably not. If you were
graduated from high school
more than a few years ago.
A number, I learned in the
eighth grade recently is a con
cept concerning the siae of a
group of objects, while a num
eric! is a written representation
of the number.
There may be many numer
als for the same number. Ten
can be written as 10, X or 20
over 2.
This distinction is one of
many elements that have been
added to the mathematics cur
riculum, making it incompre
hensible to parents who start
to help their children with
homework and wind up learn
ing it themselves.
This, the so-called new
math, is taught not only at
Jefferson Junior High but at
all junior and senior high
schools in the District. The
only significant difference in
the course at Jefferson is that
students there also read about
the lives and works of the'
greatest mathematicians.
The new math actually is
not a new way of solving prob
lems. Rather, it is a different
way of presenting math, so
that students can see why they
do certain things which pre
viously were done merely be
cause a teacher said so.
""We now stress reasons and
' theory, where the old math
stresses the practical,” one
teacher said. The approach is
to have the students ""discover”
METRO AREA
and Kennedy—lay in state
there. Nearly all Presidents
since Jackson have been inau
gurated at the East Front
steps.
Altogether, “no other build
ing, not even the White House,
.Is so intimately linked with the
lives of all the people of the
United States,” the society re
marks in its new history.
In its pages, writes Mr.
Schwengel, “1 compressed the
story of the majestic edifice
that is our Capitol—how it
came about, how it grew, and
why it stands as a symbol in
stone es the- success of our
Republic.’'
The IHrpage book has 175
illustrations, 136 of them in co
lor. It wfll well for 52.75 In a
cloth-bound, and 81.25 in a
paper-beund edition.
Copies may ordered from
the Capitol HiAorical Society,
House of Representatives,
Washington, D. C.
Mr. Schwengel is working
with the leadership in Congress
toward an arrangement for
selling this and future publica
tions of the society at the Cap
itol, Just as the White House
Guide Book is sold at the Exe
cutive Mansion.
Senator Hayden, Democrat
of Arizona, is chairman of the
society's honorary board of
trustees, which includes Presi
dent Johnson. President Ken
nedy was a board member. * •
The book was produced by
the National Geographic Socie
ty as a public service. It has an
introduction by the historian
Allan Nevins, a vice president
of the historical society, who
notes that moet of the State
capitols erected since the na

Mrs. Moran explained that I
had regrouped numerals from
one base to another.
The base is the number
which is used for the funda
mental unit of grouping in a
numeration system. The system
we use is called the decimal
system because the unit of
grouping is 10.
For any base, the highest
digit used is one less than the
base. The base four system, for
example uses only 0,1. 2 and 3.
Thus a number will be ex
pressed differently in different
Broyhill Proposes
New Bridge Group
Representative Broyhill,
Republican of Virginia, said
today he will set up a special
committee to try to reach a
prompt decision on the site for
a new Potomac River crossing.
Mr. Broyhill’s proposal,
announced in the wake of a
major attack by Virginia offi
cials on a Rosslyn-Georgetown
bridge plan, was indorsed today
by the House District Commit
tee.
Mr. Broyhill said he will
invite both officials and citizen
representatives to meet in an
effort to pin down a satisfacto
ry bridge site.
The emergency committee,
he said, is to be made up of
representatives of the District.
Virginia. Arlignton County, the
National Park Service, the
Federal Bureau of Public
Roads, and of citizen groups on
both sides of the river.
Mr. Broyhill said he also will
invite Charles A. Horsky, White
House adviser on Washington
area affairs.
Mr. Broyhill said his goal is
to end the delays on reaching
some firm decision on where to
build a new Potomac River
span.
The proposal to build the
Ros s1 y n-Georgetown bridge
came from a special committee
formed at the request of Presi
dent Kennedy.
Mr. Broyhill said opposition
to the proposal from Virginia
was justified because of the
construction impact on new
and improved property in
Rosslyn.
Downstream Site Opposed
The White House Advisory
Committee had favored a site
downstream from Key Bridge
Virginia officials yesterday said
they are strongly opposed to
the downstream route.
Mr. Broyhill said he did not
want to prejudge any recom
mendation from the committee
he is forming, but it appeared
that the compromise route
would be somewhere upstream
from Key Bridge but below the
rejected Three Sisters Island
location.
The effect of an ahnounce
ment yesterday was that Vir
ginia and Arlington officials
have won their battle to keep
sites, other than the route
backed by the White House
committee, open for considera
tion.
The two Virginia authorities
are to make joint studies of a
site upstream from Key bridge,
and another tunnel-bridge
crossing near the old Three
Sisters Island site. The District
is to make engineering studies
of a site downstream from Key
which won approval
last month from an arbitration
committee appointed by the
late President Kennedy.
The announcement about the
studies for the three sites came
after a strategy meeting yester
day between District Engineer
Commissioner Charles M. Duke
and Arlington County and Vir
ginia Highway Department
officials.
Three Sisters Site is Out
The officials also agreed that
the old Three Sisters Island
site, between Spout Run Park
in Virginia and Glover-Arch
bold Park in the District, would
bases. The solution to the prob
lem I had solved, 27, was the
numeral in base 10 for the cor
responding numeral, 123, in
base four. I
The problems Mrs. Moran
had put on the board were ex
ercises in changing numbers
from one base to another. In
regrouping from bases one
through nine to base 10, the
first number on the right is
multiplied by one, the second
number is multiplied by the
base, and the third number is
multiplied by the square of the
base.
But it’s not only the ad
vanced material like this that
puzzles parents; it’s also the
new language children learn,
like number sentences, associa
tive property and the distinc
tion between number and num
eral.
The associative property for
addition refers to a principle
which was always understood,
but never named to school chil
dren. It means that the way
numbers are grouped for addi
tion does not affect the sum:
(2 plus 3) plus 4 is the same as
2 plus (3 plus 4).
We knew that all along; we
just didn’t know what to call
, it.
Another way teachers give
children a clearer understand
ing of mathematics is by pre
senting what might be called a
■ background briefing.
One of the first things
taught to seventh graders is
how the Egyptians and Babylo
nians counted. This leads to
the conclusion that our system
is superior because it has
. ""place value""; that is, a nu-'

meral's significance is deter
mined by its relationship to
other numerals. The numeral 2
means different things when
written after a 1 (12) and
when written before al (21).
Zero, students learn, is im
portant as a place holder, and
even when it is alone it isn’t
meaningless. “Zero is a point
on the number line,” one
eighth grade teacher explained
to her class. “It tells us how
much of something we have. It
may say, ‘I don’t have any
money in the bank,' and that’s
very meaningful, isn’t it?”
When students reach the
ninth grade they leave general
math and get into a specialty—
algebra. Still the terms of the
new math, like number senten
ces (which are equations that
are either true or false) and
Integers (sine numbers) contin
ue.
Algebra was the one class in
which I took a test so that the
students could see what I had
learned. The teacher, Mrs.
Marguerite Howard, of Gordon,
read off a list of 10 problems.
(One of them, included for my
benefit, I’m sure, was “7 minus
3 equals?”)
When we finished, Mrs. How
ard asked how many scored a
hundred. A few students raised
their hands.
As she continued down the
scale and it became apparent
that I hadn’t done too well, she
asked in my direction, ""Should
I go on?”
“Yeah! Yeah!” my class
mates shouted mercilessly.
I got a 30.
Tomorrow: How impressive is Hie
Jefferson Plan?
District and Virginia have veto
powers over the bridge.
The strategy session broke
up on a note of cordial co-op
eration. Gen. Duke said he was
confident the differences over
the site could be worked out,
and Mr. Richards said he was
""quite heartened by the spirit
of co-operation and the desire
on the part of the District to
undertake a joint study.”
The site downstream from
Key Bridge was one of three
sites considered by the policy
advisory committee appointed
by President Kennedy.
However, the committee did
not rule out an upstream site,
as long as It was not at the
Three Sisters Island site.

i Plan to Widen
i N.E. Street
' Is Tabled
City planners today balked
at a proposal to widen a seven
block section of a Northeast
street that has been the scene
of five traffic deaths In the
last two years.
The National Capital Plan
ning Commission voted to table
a motion to approve the $65.-
000 widening of South Dakota
avenue between Rhode Island
.avenue and Bladensburg road
N.E.
The Planrflng Commission
has an advisory role with the
Federal Bureau of the Budget,
which this month is to give fl
n*l White House clearance to
. the next District budget.
Two Projects Approved
The planners approved two
other highway projects. These
, were a $7.3 million Ninth street
expressway between Constitu
tion avenue and the Southwest
freeway and a $400,,000 widen
ing of New York avenue be
tween First street and Bla
densburg road N.E.
In the debate on the South
Dakota avenue project. Mrs.
James H. Rowe. jr„ chairman
of the commission, said the
talk about traffic deaths “cer
tainly put the commission on
' 1 the spot.”
Mrs. Rowe said the planning

street widening in its work now

house on considerations other
than population because this is
done in the United States Sen
ate
A three-judge Federal court
ruled in the Delaware case that
the State's House of Represen
tatives must be based strictly
on population and that popula
tion must be the principal fac
tor in the Senate.
I i
Three Major Points
1 Between them. Attorney Vin
cent A. Theisen, of Wilming
ton. and the Solicitor General
; maintained that:
1. Delaware’s three countiesi
talked too long about the need
to reduce high war-time tax
rates. “We have about reached
the point where it is desirable
to see what would come out”
of a tax cut, he said.
Mr. Martin warned that tax
cuts will increase budget
deficits, and Treasury borrow
ing to finance these deficits
may raise interest rates for
private borrowers.
This will happen, he said, if
the tax bill stimulates the econ
omy to the point where busi
ness needs more credit to
expand.
It would be a mistake. Mr.
Martin said, for the Federal
Reserve to ease monetary pol
icy in an effort to hold interest
rates down in such circum
stances.
If the Federal Reserve tried
to help the Treasury finance
the deficit in that way, he said,
the process would amount to
’ printing money and causing in
i flation.
i He said the Treasury must
never were sovereign units, and
thus are unlike States given
equal representation in the
United States Senate in the
compromise that formed the |
Nation.
2. In any event, State Sena
tors in Delaware do not rep
resent counties. Under a 1963
reapportionment, 21 Senators
are divided among election dis-1
tricts in the three counties,
seven in each county.
3. While Congress apportions
its House of Representatives by
population. Delaware does not.
Twenty-eight per cent of the
finance budget deficits to the
maximum practical extent by
borrowing out of savings, not
by reliance on selling bonds
to the banking system. In
creased sales of bonds to the
banking system would require
the Federal Reserve to follow
easy money policies, greatly ex
panding the supply of money
and credit.
Mr. Martin said budget defi
cits in the past couple of years
have been financed without in
flation. and he expressed con
fidence that the same process
i can continue after taxes are
cut—at the price of higher in
terest rates.
’ The Federal Reserve's re-
■ sponsibility for preventing in
flation causes criticism. Mr.
> Martin noted, remarking: ""We
are always in the position of
. a chaperone who takes away
1 the punch just when the party
■ is getting good.”
1 Some economists contend
’ the Federal Reserve would off
set the stimulative effects of
I tax reductions if it tightened
• monetary policy.
I. But Mr. Martin maintained
s that the real stimulus of tax
- reductions will come from in
creased incentives for invest-
II ment. not from budget deficits
people can elect a Delaware
House majority. Thirty-one per
cent can name two thirds of
the Senate.
Sees Discrimination in Act
Mr. Cos said the State’s 1963
reapportionment lacks any ra
tional basis and provides for
gross discrimination against
more populous areas “of a kind
that the Federal system hasj
never permitted.”
Attorney Frederick Bernays
Wiener, representing State and
County officials who appealed
the Delaware case to the high
court, argued the Constitution
does not require that both leg
islative houses be apportioned
by population.
Mr. Wiener, according to the
; Associated Press, told the Justi
i ces that Delaware’s plan for
reapportioning its legislature
may have represented a com
' promise but that it is not ca
’ pricous or arbitrary.
He contended the United
’ States Senate is selected on an
area basis and that only 16 per
cent of the total population
> can elect a majority of it.
The justices asked a number
of questions of the lawyers dur
-1 ing the three hours of argu
-1 ments in the Delaware case.
One exchange dealt with the
developing role of the Four-
■ teeenth Amendment’s equal
■ protection clause.
Mr. Theisen, answering an
5 argument made earlier by Mr
f Wiener in support of the 1963
' Delaware reapportionment, said
r the Fourteenth Amendment
originally had been intended to
1 bolster rights of Negroes.
Justice Harlan said from the
f bench that the second section
1 of the amendment discusses ap
portionment of Representatives
1 among the States and shows the
x drafters were thinking about
- such matters, too.
The newest justice, Justice
i. Goldberg, indicated this section
had been intended to update
constitutional language count
ing slaves in a three-fifths
-ratio for allocation represent
atives to States.
""It goes a little further than
what my Brother Goldberg

Paroled Prisoners Lose
Appeal for More Help
The Supreme Court today refused to examine a group
of proposals to provide more help for paroled Federal prisoners
fighting revocation of their paroles.
""Hie Issue was presented in two appeals by the American
Civil Liberties Union and In a third filed by a prison inmate
on his own behalf.
The ACLU’s petition for review said the cases raised ""fund-
amental constitutional and
statutory Issues previously not
dealt with by this court re
garding a critical aspect of the
Federal parole system.""
The appeals were from a
decision of the United States
Court of Appeals here denying
free counsel for indigents. con
frontation of adverse witnesses
and examination of documen
tary evidence at parole revoca
tion headings.
Five Sign in Majority
Five of the nine Court of
Appeals judges joined in a ma
jority opinion by Judge War
ren E. Burger. The others.
Chief Judge David Bazelon
and Judges Henry Edgerton.
Charles Fahy and J. Skelly
Wright, would have gone
further in granting rights
sought for the parolees.
In today’s appeal, the ACLU
said the majority opinion prop
erly provided for several other
procedural safeguards, includ
ing a preliminary hearing near
the place where a parolee was
retaken and specification of
charges upon which revocation
was being based.
Legal Representation
However, the ACLU argued
that the lower court’s opinion
""does not go as far as the Con
stitution requires.” The ACLU
maintained parole revocation
procedings should include
rights that traditionally have
been associated with judical
processes

2 Men Get SSO
At Liquor Store
Two men. one armed with
what appeared to be a cap pis
tol. robbed the Le Droit Liquor
Store, 501 Florida avenue N W.,
of 550 today and fled on foot.
It is the same store where
, Police Pvt. Donald Brereton,
i 31. was slain January 7. 1960.
in a gun battle during a hold
i up.
Police said two men entered
the store at 11:50 am. today
and one. waving what looked
like a cap pistol, ordered Ben
. jamin Bookoff, 50. the proprie
i tor. into the back room where
» the safe is kept.
The other man grabbed 650
i from the cash register. Mean
while, a customer entered the
store and Mr. Bookoff shouted
at him to call the police. The
t two bandits then fled, running
J west on Florida avenue.
The first man was described
' as about 20, 5-foot-7 and 130
pounds. The second was 5-foot
-10 and wearing a tan coat.
' Both were Negroes, according

! Continued From Page A-l
‘ ""The judgment of the Supreme
1 Court of Alabama is reversed.” |
: The State court had upheld the
F convictions.
> The high court cited two
landmark decisions in support
of today’s ruling. Lack of evi
dence was cited in both.
The first was the courts
1960 decision upsetting the
conviction of a Louisville <KyJ
Negro on charges of loitering
and disorderly conduct as being
so devoid of evidenciary sup
port that they violated the due
process clause of the 14th
Amendment.
The second was the court s
1961 decision in its first sit-in
case, upsetting conviction of
demonstrators in Louisiana on
the narrow ground that there
was no evidence their actions
had involved a disturbance of
the peace.
In the arguments last week.
Melvin L. Wulf, the ACLU’s
legal director, had told the
justices the injunction against
the two party leaders was an
unconstitutional prior restraint
on freedom of speech.
An attorney representing
Fairfield argued that the city
fathers obtained the injunc
tion to head off activity they
thought would ""subvert peace
and good order in our city.”
That there was no evidence
to support the convictions was
the point argued by Assistant

partment's civil rights division.
In another case involving
civil rights, three Negroes
of Jackson. Miss., were denied
a Supreme Court review of
their efforts to get injunctions
against enforcement of State
segregation laws and against a
State policy of what they called
""enforced racial discrimination
in public futilities.""
The high court acted on an
appeal from a State court rul
ing that said the three individ
ual Negro plaintiffs had not
been arrested or threatened
with arrest and that they had
a right to use the Jackson fa
cilities. Their case was not a
class action benefiting any
other Negroes, the State court
added.
“The decision below, by
granting relief solely to the
named plaintiffs in this suit,
permits the State to continue
its unlawful practice or racial
discrimination against other
Negro citizens,” the appeal said.
The Supreme Court gave no
reason for its denial.
In another action, the Su-
preme Court refused to review'
a ruling that the Government
is liable to Capital Airlines and
the windows of two Capital pi
lots for damages in the 1958
mid-air crash of a Capital
plane and an Air National
Guard jet trained near Bruns
wick, Md.
Eleven persons aboard the
Capital flight and a passenger
in the jet trainer were killed
The pilot of the trainer, Capt.
Julius R. McCoy, was the only
survivor.
