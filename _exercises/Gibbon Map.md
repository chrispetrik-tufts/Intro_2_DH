# Gibbon's Roman Empire in Chapters 38, 39, and 40

This is my map. https://tuftsgis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/sidebar/index.html?appid=2be556dbdfc1435fa323fa9cc9443386

I think it is pretty cool. I made it bubblegum themed because I feel like Gibbon would very much appreciate that. I added all of the locations my code could find from chapters 38, 39, and 40. I added only one external map because I thought that the layering looked gross.
