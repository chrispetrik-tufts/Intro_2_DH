But consider Canada with a $1 billion\\nadverse trade balance.\\nAlso, while we have $40 billion net in foreign\\nassets abroad, Canada has a net external debt of\\nabout $17 billion.\\nTranslate both of these to our scale and it is as\\nthough we had a $10 billion annual adverse trade\\nbalance and $200 billion in external debt.\\nBut because we are concerned over the drain on\\nour gold and our adverse balance of payments, we are\\ntaking measures which may worsen Canada’s plight.\\nThe “Buy American” directive, if rigidly en\\nforced, could result in substantial dollar losses to\\nCanada—who, incidentally, buys 60 per cent of her\\nimports from us. . . .\\nThe consequence of this is that the new Canadian\\nbudget revealed recently contains several proposals\\ndesignated to make investment of American capital\\nin Canada less attractive. . . .\\nIn no sense is this “retaliation” on Canada’s part.\\nIt is simply that our two nations are in the same econ\\nomic boat, when we start rocking same, Canada has\\nto take offsetting action.\\nThis is an important factor for the new Adminis\\ntration to keep in mind when it tackles the problem\\nof our balance of payments.

Until that is\\ncompleted — by the end of this\\nmonth — and turned over to the\\nPresident and his budget makers,\\nno firm estimate of the revised\\nmilitary budget can be made.\\nHowever, some preliminary\\nmoves, made in response to Ken\\nnedy’s request for accelerated ac\\ntion in defense programs, obvi\\nously will cost more money which\\npresumably would appear in the\\nrevised fiscal 1962 bill.\\nFirst of these items is addition\\nof 55 jet and propjet transport\\nplanes for troop and cargo air\\nlift.\\nResponding to the President’s\\nrequest, the Pentagon — like other\\nfederal departments — is trying\\nto eliminate spending for items or\\norganizations that have become\\nobsolete.\\nBut the constantly mounting re\\nquirements of defense virtually\\nassure that an increase in military\\nspending is in prospect.\\nThese requirements arise out\\nof the unrelenting arms race with\\nthe Communist powers and swift\\nstrides made in weapon technol\\nogy.

No,\\nsaid Mr. Eisenhower.\\nReady for the question, the\\nPresident read to the reporters a\\nformal statement that was ob\\nviously designed (1) to reassure\\nthe people of Cuba on American\\ngood intentions, and <2> to place\\nthe thorny Cuban issue in the\\nopen, especailly for the edifica\\ntion of other Latin American\\nnations. In it he warned Cuba,\\nand indirectly other nations of\\nthe Western Hemisphere, that it\\nwas necessary “to recognize and\\ndefeat the intrigues of interna\\ntional communism which are\\naimed at destroying democratic\\ninstitutions in Cuba and the tra\\nditional and mutually beneficial\\nfriendship between the Cuban and\\nAmerican peoples.”\\nvoluntary quotas unless Hong\\nKong institutes similar ones.\\nHong Kong has performed the\\nincredible feat of increasing cot\\nton textile exports from 2.347,000\\nsquare yards in 1958 to 27,884,000\\nsquare yards in 1959.\\nCotton textile makers here also\\nare concerned about the trend\\nin other Asian exports, India\\'s\\nexports have gone from 1,274,000\\nsquare yards in 1958 to 14,335,000\\nin 1959.

He is Martin\\nGainsbrueh of the National In\\ndustrial Conference Board.\\nWhile it appears that\\' the in\\ndistry won\\'t get such quotas in\\nthe near future, its representatives\\nfeel they are making progress in\\nthe direction of protectionism.\\nTheir greatest coup has been their\\nsuccess in persuading the White\\nHouse to investigate the advisa\\nbility of increasing present tariffs.\\nPresident Eisenhower has di\\nrected the Tariff Commission to\\nmake an investigation to deter\\nmine whether this is so. In his\\ncommunication to the commission,\\nthe President said he had been\\nadvised by the Secretary of Ag\\nriculture that export subsidies are\\na loss to the extent of imports to\\nthe United States.\\nThe cost of the cotton export\\nsubsidy program from its inception\\nin 1956 through the current mar\\nketing year is estimated at $7OO\\nmillion. The amount of the subsidy\\nvaries each year.\\nFor the 1956-7 marketing year\\nthe Agriculture Department\\'s\\nCommodity Credit Corporation\\npaid a subsidy of 6\\'2 cents a\\npound on 7.6 million bales of cot\\nton for a total cost of $241 million.\\nThe following year the subsidy was\\nreduced to 5 cents a pound, and\\nexports under it dropped to 5.7\\nmillion bales. The export drop re\\nsulted in the subsidy being re\\nstored to 6’-2 cents for the fol\\nlowing year, when it failed to boost\\nexports. Instead they dropped to\\n2.8 million bales, and subsidy pay\\nments, though at the original rate,\\ntotaled only $9l million.\\nFor the 1959-60 marketing year\\nthe rate has been boosted to a\\nrecord 8 cents a pound. Agricul\\nture Department officials expect\\nexports to total 5.5 million bales\\nfor a subsidy cost of $220 million.\\nFinancing Subsidy Plan\\nObviously the Agriculture De\\npartment is interested in cotton\\ntextile tariffs as a means of fi\\nnancing its multi - million - dollar\\nexport subsidy program. The cot\\nton manufacturers, however, look\\nupon a tariff as a step along the\\nroad of protectionism which they\\nhope will lead to quotas limiting\\nquanities of imports.\\nThey reason that levying of new\\ncotton textile duties would be at\\nleast a tacit acknowledgment of\\na need for curtailment of imports.\\nThey then explain that when it\\nbecomes obvious that tariffs will\\nnot do this, then a further step\\nmav be taken.\\nThe mill representatives think\\nit is a hopeful sign that they have\\nbeen able to get .their product di\\nrectly associated with the agri\\ncultural program.

Pelly, R-Wash., in\\ntroduced a bill Tuesday that\\nwould substitute a regional\\nallocation system for the dif\\nferential setup.\\nTollefson said the compro\\nmise proposal would be offer\\ned in the form of two amend\\nments to the 1936 law that\\nprovides for the differential.\\nOne amendment would sub\\nstitute a 4% differential for\\nthe present 6%. This, he said,\\nis based on a recent report by\\nthe maritime administration\\nwhich concluded that a 4.2%\\ncost differential exists on the\\nWest Coast in comparison\\nwith ship construction on the\\nEast. Gulf, and Great Lakes\\ncoasts.\\nThe second amendment\\nwould establish a regional\\ncontract allocation system\\nunder which the secretary of\\ncommerce could ask for bids\\non ship construction in a\\nspecific area if ha found the\\nwork was needed there be\\ncause of a depressed con\\ndition in the industry.\\nPelly’s bill would have a\\nsimilar arrangement. His\\namendment would provide for\\nthe number of ships involving\\nconstruction subsidies to be\\ndivided into four groups at the\\nbeginning of each fiscal year.\\nOne group would be designat\\ned for each of the coasts.\\nThe groups would be figur\\ned on the basis of the over-all\\nnumber of subsidy contracts\\navailable in relation to the\\nfacilities in privately owned\\nshipyards in each region that\\nare equipped to build the\\nships.\\nPally axplainad that if iha\\nsecretary of commerce de\\ntermined the lowest bid re\\nceived under such an ar\\nrangement. he would reject\\nall bids from that region\\nand invite bids on a nation\\nwide basis.\\nThe differential was origin\\nally set up on the ground that\\nship construction costs are\\ngreater on the West Coast\\nthan on the East Colmer and\\nother opponents of the differ\\nential contend it is no longer\\nneeded.\\nAmong all the flags of the\\nUnited Nations, only that of\\nCyprus bears a map of the\\ncountry.\\n.....\\nMR.

Alaska, under Act of March 3, 1879.\\nPassman Disgusted\\n^CONGRESSMAN OTTO PASSMAN, the Louisiana Democrat\\n^ who heads a House subcommittee which supervises foreign\\naid, has just returned from a trip all over the world—a trip de\\nsigned to appraise the country’s aid program.\\nWhat the hard-fighting Congressman has to say is of interest\\nto every American taxpayer: in brief, he is thoroughly disgusted\\nwith the aid program.\\nOne of the aims for which our money is going, in some\\ncountries, is to finance private or parochial schools. In this case\\nand in others we have the spectacle of State Department or other\\nappointees deciding that American tax money will be used out\\nside our borders for purposes which are specifically barred by the\\nConstitution, inside our borders.\\nBy now the foreign aid system has gained solid entrench\\nment in the way of employes, a bureaucratic organization fighting\\nfor its life and for retention of jobs, and backers who have profited\\nfrom these yearly expenditures and who will continue to profit\\nfrom them.\\nOur Peace Corps has worked well. This is aid to nations by\\nhuman beings working on very low salaries. This is the best form\\nof aid; it is understood; it is aid from the heart and in leadership\\nand technical ways that can improve a nation’s people and their\\nmaking of a living. This is the kind of aid we can expand. The\\nold money give-away should be terminated as quickly as possible.\\nPassman, no doubt reflects the will of the majority of the American\\npeople.\\nIt Can’t Happen Again\\nTHE YEARS HAVE BEEN so crowded with events that it is\\nhard to realize that thirty have passed since the bank holiday,\\n\"the day the money stopped” by decrees from Washington, But\\nthey have and Caroline Bird recalls in Look the courage, tragedy\\nand humor of March 6, 1933.\\nYes, there was a bit of humor. For one thing the late John\\nD. Rockefeller, Sr., ran out of dimes and had to give his golf\\ncaddy a dollar. There were novel ways of continuing business.\\nIn Atlanta, a taxi driver accepted postage stamps. In Buffalo,\\na winning prize fighter received his purse in potatoes and toma\\ntoes. All of us who were alive then have stories of our own.\\nAccording to the article, this cannot happen again. Federal\\nDeposit Insurance, paid for by banks themselves, now guarantees\\nbank accounts up to $10,000. More important, there are fewer\\nbanks, and they are stronger. Economic indicators exist to forecast\\ntrouble.\\n\"Almost everybody,” says Miss Bird, \"now distinguishes be\\ntween real wealth and the yellow stuff.”\\nConsidering that the United States now owes more gold than\\nit owns, this is important—if true!\\nHouse Turns\\nDown w4Liberty”\\nAmendment to\\nU.S. Constitution\\nJUNEAU OF) — The House Tues\\nday turned down a resolution pro\\nposing a so-called “liberty” amend\\nment to the U.S. Constitution by\\na vote of 10-27.\\nThe proposed amendment would\\nprohibit the federal government\\nfrom engaging in any kind of\\nbusiness except as specified in the\\nConstitution, and ultimately would\\nprohibit it from collecting personal\\nincome taxes.\\nThe vote came after more than\\nan hour’s debate which ran past\\nthe noon hour.\\nBefore the final tally, the House\\nturned down two attempts to\\namend the measure.\\nThe first, sponsored by Rep.\\nMike Gravel, would have exempt\\ned a long list of federal activities\\nin Alaska, such as the Bureau of\\nIndian Affairs, public housing,\\naid to education, the Army Corps\\nof Engineers, the Alaska Railroad,\\npublic airports, and the like. That\\none went down on a 15-17 roll\\ncall count.\\nThe second amendment, offered\\nby Rep. John Rader, would have\\nspecifically exempted such power\\nprojects as the proposed Rampart\\nDam, and the Bradley Lake and\\nSnettisham hydroelectric projects.\\nThat one failed by a vote of 13-19.\\nIn both cases, the authors of the\\namendments argued that those\\nwho wanted to go along with the\\nproposed constitutional amend\\nment “should realize that they’d\\nhave to live with it at home.”\\nRep. Wm. Boardman said that\\nwhile many of the lawmakers\\nmight sympathize with the amend\\nments, the measure should be kept\\nuniform since it also was being\\nconsidered by other states.\\nSpeaking for the resolution, Rep.\\nEarl Hillstrand, said that he was\\none of the sponsors of the meas\\nure “not entirely because of its\\ncontents, but because it is a blow\\nagainst something of which I do\\nnot approve—bigger and bigger\\ngovernment.”\\n“I fail to grasp the practical ap\\nplication of this measure in this\\nday and age,” said Rep. John Holm.\\n“Perhaps we should have passed\\nit 50 or 150 years ago. But right\\nnow it has little other than pro\\ntest value.”\\nIn the final vote, those in favor\\nof the measure were: Reps. Baker,\\nBoardman, Cole, Hillstrand, Leon\\nard, Miller, Parsons, Tillion and\\nWhite.\\nMarie Drake, Author of\\nAlaska Flag Song, Passes\\nJUNEAU WP>. — Mrs. Marie\\nDrake, the author of the words to\\nAlaska’s Flag Song, died here yes\\nterday after a long illness.\\nMrs. Drake came to Alaska after\\nthe end of World War I and took\\nemployment with the Territorial\\nDepartment of Education, rising\\nto the post of Assistant Commis\\nsioner in 1934.\\nShe held the post until 1945.\\nThere are no known survivors.\\n\"DO IT ALL\\nWITH ONE CALL\"\\n☆\\nModern Laundry\\nAND\\nDry Cleaners\\n*\\nComplete Dry Cleaning\\nand\\nLaundry Service\\n☆\\nFOR PICK - UP\\nDial 2491\\n☆\\nJim and Ruth McLean\\nProprietors\\nJudge Hubert Gilbert\\nGives Resume of\\nComing Court Activities\\nJudge Hubert Gilbert gave a\\nresume of coming court activities\\nat the Chamber of Commerce\\nluncheon which get underway\\nMarch 12 here at Superior Court,\\nwith the grand jury which is fol\\nlowed by trials.\\nJudge Gilbert stated that the\\nlocal court should be active\\nthrough March and April with the\\namount of work to be done.

S. Babaev, a Rus\\nsian delegate to the recent North\\nPacific Fur Seal Conference in\\nTokyo.\\nWade attended the meeting as\\na representative of the State of\\nAlaska.\\nBabaev, Wade said, denied,\\n“with great feeling, that any fish\\ning Vessel captained by a Russian\\nsea captain and manned by a Rus\\nsian fishing crew would deliberate\\nly destroy or damage fishing gear\\nof another fisherman, particularly\\nan Alaskan fisherman after the\\ncooperation that has existed be\\ntween the two fishing fleets over\\nthe years.”\\nWade said Babaev told the U.S.\\ndelegates that any incident that\\nwas brought to their attention\\nwould result in complete investi\\ngation and punishment, if facts\\nwarranted it.\\nBabaev suggested that the Rus\\nsians be advised of the type and\\nkinds of markers used by Alaska\\nking crab fishermen, the general\\narea where they are located and\\nthe density of the pots.\\nHe said Russians would then\\nexercise “great and unusual care”\\nin these areas. Babaev suggested\\nthat a radio beacon of some kind\\ntuned to the radio frequency used\\nby Russian ships be set up to\\nmark the general area where\\nAmerican pots are located.\\nWade said the U.S. Fish and\\nWildlife Service, the U.S. State\\nDepartment and the Alaska State\\nDepartment of Fish and Game, as\\nwell as the American king crab\\nindustry itself, had agreed to fur\\nnish information to the Russians\\nBabaev told Wade he planned to\\nstop in Vladivostok and notify the\\nRussian fishing fleet there of his\\nconcern regarding the problem.\\nAmerican fishermen complained\\nlast year of a heavy loss of king\\ncrab gear caused by the activities\\nof Russian trawlers which were\\noperating in the same general\\narea, off the southern tip of Ko\\ndiak Island.\\nPROPOSE TRANSFERS\\nJUNEAU Oft—Two pieces of leg\\nislation were introduced in the\\nSenate Tuesday by Nome Demo\\ncrats Lester Bronson and Pearse\\nWalsh.\\nThe first, SB 130, calls for the\\ntransfer of the Forestry, Parks and\\nRecreation branch of the Division\\nof Lands from the Anchorage area\\nto Juneau.\\nThe other, SB131, would trans\\nfer the Division of Aviation from\\nthe Anchorage area to the Fair\\nbanks area.\\n\\' Miners & Merchants Bank of Alaska\\n\"The Friendly Bank\"\\nFULL BANKING SERVICES\\nTo Northwestern Alaska Since 1904\\n— BRANCHES IN KOTZEBUE and BARROW —\\nGuaranteed\\nDependable\\nFuel Service\\nLP Gas\\nand Appliances\\nOffice: Dial 2561 Res: Dial 2417\\nDEAL WITH CONFIDENCE AT\\nGreen’s City Fuel and Transfer\\nZIEGLER\\nand\\nQUAKER\\nSTOVE PARTS\\nAND REPAIRS\\nOIL HEATERS'},\n",

Examines\\nSecond Amendment\\nBy GEORGE KENNEDY\\nThe second article of the\\n10 original amendments, the\\nBill of Rights of the Con\\nstitution of the United\\nStates, reads:\\n\"A well regulated militia\\nbeing necessary to the se\\ncurity of of a free State, the\\nright of the people to keep\\nand bear arms shall not be\\ninfringed.\\nThe term \"Bill of Rights”\\nand the provisions for the\\nright to bear arms come\\nfrom the English Bill of\\nRights passed by Parlia\\nment after the bloodless\\nrevolution of 1688 which\\nplaced William, the Duke of\\nOrange and his wife, Mary,\\ndaughter of the deposed\\nJames 11, on the throne.\\nThe English bill of rights\\nwas a limitation imposed by\\nParliament over the power\\nof the monarchy.\\nIn his final futile efforts\\nto preserve his authority,\\nJames had asembled a force\\nof 20,000 men at Hounslow\\nHeath.\\nThe maintenance of a\\nstanding army In peacetime\\nbecame regarded as an in\\nstrument of regal tyranny.\\nAlong with trial by Jury\\nand indictment by grand\\njuries, the right to bear arms\\nwas written into the revolu\\ntionary document.\\nThis provision, a century\\n□lder than our constitu\\ntional amendment, did not\\nprevent Britain from be\\ncoming an unarmed com\\nmunity.\\nRecently a bank robber\\nwas shot and killed by a\\nbank guard In England.\\nThis was generally consid\\nered unfortunate and the\\nGuardian asked why bank\\nguards were allowed to\\ncarry pistols when the po\\nlice were not.\\n_o\\nMANY OF THE provisions\\nof our Bill of Rights con\\ncemipg freedom of religion,\\nfreedom of speech and free\\ndom of Che press were sug\\ngested a^ l debated in the\\noorlsotutlonal convention\\nin Philadelphia in 1887.\\nThey were rejected be\\ncause. it was 1e44 that\\ndenying certain powers\\nto the Federal Government\\nthey were creating would\\nImply that otherwise it\\nwould have such power. The\\nFederal government was to\\nhave no powers except those\\nenumerated in the doument.\\nWhen the Constitution\\nwent to the States—it was\\nto go into effect when nine\\nof the 13 had ratified It—\\nit was understood that sug\\ngested amendments would\\nbe considered by the Con\\ngress it was creating.\\nMore than 200 amend\\nments were suggested by\\nthe State conventions. Many\\nsuggested the same thing in\\ndifferent words. The pro\\nvisions had to do with reli\\ngion, right of petition, right\\nof assembly, right to bail.\\nThese amendments were\\nall limitations on the power\\nof the Federal government,\\nnot on the States. The prob\\nlem was not easy. Present\\nday shibboleths such as\\n“freedom of religion,” and\\n“separation of church and\\nState” would not get the\\nfirst Congress over the\\nthe passes of Jordan.\\no\\nTAKE THE WORDING of\\nthe First Amendment:\\n“Congress shall make no\\nlaw restricting an establish\\nment of religion or pro\\nhibiting the free exercise\\nthereof.”\\nMassachusetts had an es\\ntablished religion Con\\ngregationalism, which con\\ntinued until 1833. The Epis\\ncopal Church in Maryland\\nto this day, in establlshling\\na new parish, requests an\\nact of the legislature and\\nthe legislature obliges.\\nIt was James Madison,\\n“the Father of the Consti\\ntution,” who undertook to\\nplease the States by having\\nCongress pass amendments.\\nThis was in the first session\\nof Congress in 1789 in New\\nYork City Hall.\\nAs in recent legislation,\\nthe first Congress wrote the\\nSecond Amendment in con\\nference.\\nThe House version had a\\nprovision to exempt\\nscientous objector from\\nbearing arms. The Senate\\nversion did not have it, and\\nit was dropped by the con\\nferees.\\n“Militia” at that time\\nmeant that every able bodied\\nman should respond, with\\nfire arms, to the summons\\nof the States.\\nThat’s how the Second\\nAmendment got into the\\nConstitution and there it is\\ntoday.\\nArmy Unit OKs\\nHigh Dam Plan\\nFor Seneca\\n8 Projects Win\\nApproval for\\nPotomac Basin\\nBy LEE FLOR\\nStar Staff Writer\\nA key Army Engineers’ re\\nview board has recommended\\nconstruction of the controver\\nsial high dam and reservoir at\\nSeneca on the Potomac River.\\nThe Seneca recommenda\\ntions were part of a proposal\\nfor eight major reservoirs, esti\\nmated to cost 3242 million, on\\nthe Potomac River and its tri\\nbutaries.\\nThe recommendations call\\nfor complete Congressional au\\nthorization for about half of a\\nSSOO million, 18-reservoir Poto\\nmac Basin plan recommended\\nlast April, and ask for limited\\ncongressional approval for\\nmore study for the last half of\\nthe basin plan.\\nThe review board, the Board\\nof Engineers for Rivers and\\nHarbors of the Army Corps of\\nEngineers, made its recommen\\ndations yesterday to Lt. Gen.\\nW. K.

However, ad\\nvance acquisition of the site\\nmay be authorized by Congress,\\nand this may start within a\\nfew years.\\nThe next step in the ela\\nborate process required for ap\\nproval of the basin plan is for\\nGen. Wilson and his staff to\\ncomplete a preliminary report\\nto Congress.\\nThis may be completed with\\nin three months The prelimi\\nnary report automatically, un\\nder Federal legislation, goes for\\nreview to the District Commis\\nsloners, the Governors of\\nMaryland. Virginia, Pennsyl\\nvania ond West Virginia, and\\nto key Federal agencies.\\n©•er Dams in Plan\\nThe other major reservoirs,\\nestimated cost, and the pro\\nposed completion date for con- :\\nstruction, are as follows:\\nRoyal Glen, W.

It has a tentative\\ncompletion date of 1965.\\nThe Seneca Dam has been\\nheavily opposed in the Wash\\nington area because it would\\nneed about 44,000 acres of land\\nin Maryland and Virginia.

F. new, dispatches.\\nA-12\\nTHURSDAY, JANUARY 19, 1961\\nGracious Good-Bye\\nPresident Eisenhower’s final news\\nconference was a pleasantly relaxed\\naffair.\\nAlthough the elght-year record of\\nsuch meetings shows that Mr„ Eisen\\nhower met the newsmen and women\\nfewer times and more Irregularly than\\ndid his immediate Democratic prede\\ncessors, Franklin Roosevelt and Harry\\nTruman, it likewise shows very few\\noccasions of anything approaching un\\npleasant or embarrassing exchanges.\\nAnd if Mr. Eisenhower did not often\\ndisplay as much relish for tilting with\\nthe correspondents as his predecessors,\\nit is worth noting that the conference\\npractice itself was brought to a new\\nhigh level of public usefulness. For the\\nfirst time, for example, verbatim tran\\nscripts were made available quickly\\nafter the conferences, with the privilege\\nof direct quotation.\\nIt is a questionable innovation,\\nIncidentally, which President-elect Ken\\nnedy is proposing in the holding of “live”\\nnews conferences before the television\\ncameras. Undoubtedly there will be no\\nlack of public interest in such meetings.\\nBut we think there is serious doubt that\\na Chief Executive in a spontaneous\\nquestion-and-answer session can guard\\nagainst an inadvertent word or gesture\\nthat might be misinterpreted by the\\nviewing audience with potentially harm\\nful result. Even a “no comment” in some\\ncircumstances can be translated into a\\nvariety of meanings—here and abroad.\\nTo return to Mr. Eisenhower’s fare\\nwell, it was in keeping with his currently\\nmellow mood on the eve of retirement.\\nAgain, as he did on the previous evening,\\nhe wished “Godspeed” to his successor\\nand expressed, satisfaction at the\\nsmoothness of the transition from one\\nadministration to another. His concern\\nthat this periodic transfer of power\\nshould be accomplished efficiently and\\nharmoniously was reflected in his\\ninteresting proposal that it might be\\nwise to advance election and inaugural\\ndates, by constitutional amendment, to\\ngive an incoming President more time\\nto prepare plans and programs for a\\nnew Congress. Os his personal plans,\\nit was in keeping also with the record\\nof his lifetime that he implied a willing\\nness to serve Nation or party further if\\nit seemed in the public Interest.\\nFor their part, it was evident that\\nthe near-record number of assembled\\ncorrespondents were in a mood respon\\nsive to the President\\'s own. Figuratively,\\nwe join them in their applause at this\\nfinal “Thank you, Mr. President.”\\nNew Man at Justice\\nAs most people expected, and as we\\n•think should have been the case, the\\nnomination of Robert Kennedy as\\nAttorney General sailed smoothly\\nthrough the sometimes stormy waters\\nof the Senate Judiciary Committee.\\nExcept for a bit of Republican heckling,\\nthe much-advertised “hearing” on his\\nnomination turned out to be pretty\\nmuch of a love feast. The consensus\\nwas, and, in fact, had to be that this\\nyoung man’s qualifications as the\\nNation’s chief legal officer would be\\njudged, not on his record, which is\\nnegligible, but on the basis of his per\\nformance, which we hope will be of a\\nhigh order.\\nThis hope certainly finds support in\\nthe experience of the outgoing Attorney\\nGeneral, William Pierce Rogers. When\\nBill Rogers came to the Justice Depart\\nment as Deputy Attorney General in\\n1953 he was older, but not much older,\\nthan Bobby Kennedy is now. He had\\nhad more experience in the practice\\nof law, but one would hardly say that\\nthe Rogers star had shone so brightly\\nas to overwhelm and dim the light of\\nhis contemporaries at the bar. Never\\ntheless, as he prepares to step aside at\\nthe still youthful age of 47, we have\\nno doubt as to the nature of the\\nInformed judgment respecting his\\ncareer as Attorney General. It will be\\nthat he has served with distinction.\\nThe reason, or at least the primary\\nreason, is that Attorney General Rogers\\nhas devoted himself to serving and\\nfurthering the cause of justice. It\\nfollows necessarily that he has not used\\nhis position to pay political debts or to\\ninflict political punishments. Although\\na close friend and warm supporter of\\nRichard Nixon, he has not attempted\\nto use his office to promote eithbr his\\nfriend’s or his own political fortunes.\\nInstead, to repeat, he has devoted him\\nself with notable efficiency to the job at\\nhand—the fair and vigorous adminis-\\ntration of justice. If Bobby Kennedy\\ndoes as well, those who have complained\\nof his youth, his Inexperience, nepotism,\\nor what have you, will find themselves\\nwith a large self-serving of words to eat.\\nMr. K. and Our Coil\\nAlthough It must remain constantly\\non guard against the ever-present threat\\nof Communist subversion and aggres\\nsion, the free world has reason to view\\nwith great calm, if not contempt, Nikita\\nKhrushchev’s assertion that the day is\\n\"not far off” when Red totalitarianism\\nwill conquer and rule the entire globe.\\nAfter all, the ebullient Soviet\\ndictator has long since demonstrated\\nthat his crystal ball is more than a\\nlittle bit clouded. At any rate, he has\\nlooked at it in the past and seen things\\nin it that were not really there. Thus,\\nto cite but one example of his faulty\\nclairvoyance, he has repeatedly pre\\ndicted that agriculture in the USSR\\nwould by this time be equalling or ex\\nceeding our own country’s tremendous\\nfarm output. Actually, however, the\\nRussian economy in that respect con\\ntinues to lag far behind ours—enough\\nso to constitute a potential crisis in view\\nof the fact that Russia’s fast-multi\\nplying population is sharply out of pace\\nwith the food supply.\\nBut this failure of his agricultural\\nforecasts apparently has not discouraged\\n,Mr. Khrushchev from predicting that\\nthe whole earth—including the United\\nStates —will soon be under the mastery\\nof communism. This will be brought\\nabout, he has suggested, not by all-out\\nwar, but by a system of \"peaceful co\\nexistence” under which the Red total!-,\\ntariani will win control of everything\\neverywhere—north, east, south and west\\n—throughout this mortal coil we call\\nour world. Presumably, the sheer charm\\n• of Soviet agents will speed up the con\\nquest, but if that is not enough, then the\\nmilitary power of the USSR—as Mr. K.\\nhas hinted, with the subtlety of a\\nsledge-hammer—will be used against\\nany “capitalist” power (meaning espe\\ncially our own country) daring to resist\\nthe forces of Communist “liberation.”\\nIn setting forth this thesis in the\\n20,000-word speech that has just been\\npublished in Moscow, Mr. Khrushchev\\n. has had some interesting things to say\\nabout war. He does not like the idea of\\na big nuclear conflict. He does not like\\nit because he thinks it would be as bad\\nfor the Soviet Union as for the United\\nStates. Nor does he like “brush-fire”\\nfights that could lead to a major ex\\nplosion. Indeed, as far as shooting is\\nconcerned, the only thing he seems to\\nfavor is the “liberation” struggle—as in\\nAlgeria and Cuba—where the so-called\\n“revolutionary” forces, if not actually\\nin cahoots with the Kremlin, are strongly\\ninclined to serve it.\\nIn that sense, of course, the wars\\nof “liberation” are limited strictly to\\nthose who fight only for the USSR.\\nCertainly, as mankind has seen, with a\\nfeeling of shock and disgust, people in\\ncountries like Hungary and Tibet\\nstruggle for liberty only at the risk of\\nbeing destroyed by the forces of Com\\nmunism. Naturally enough, Mr. Khru\\nshchev has said nothing about this and\\nhis silence on it is supremely eloquent.\\n9\\nThe Cost of Fringes\\nIt has become almost universal in\\nlabor-management contract negotia\\ntions that a package of so-called fringe\\nbenefits figures importantly at the\\nbargaining table. Although frequently\\nstated in terms that make these seem\\nrelatively insignificant, their cumula\\ntive cost in dollars has become\\nastonishingly heavy. Some, such as\\nemployer payments to the social\\nsecurity system, are Imposed by law\\nand are not subject to negotiation.\\nOthers are arrived at by direct bar\\ngaining.\\nThe National Industrial Conference\\nBoard has drawn an interesting statis\\ntical picture of how all these supple\\nments to wages and salaries—outlays\\nby employers—have mounted sharply\\nduring the past quarter of a century\\nto approximately $lB billion in 1960. At\\nthis level, they represented 7.4 per cent\\nof the $243 billion paid by Industry in\\nwages, salaries and supplements. In\\n1935, the total was about $5OO million—\\nor slightly more than 1 per cent of\\ntotal outlays to personnel. And while\\nemployer payments to social security\\namounted to $5.2 billion last year, it is\\nnotable that employer contributions to\\nprivate pension and welfare funds—\\noften subject to negotiation—totalled\\n$8.5 billion.\\nThis is a cost to industry that prob\\nably will continue to rise and is in fact\\naccepted with increased willingness by\\nmanagement. Nevertheless, the paying\\nof it constitutes a burden which all too\\noften goes unappreciated.\\n\\'To Your Health\\'\\nNext to the weather, probably no\\nsubject of conversation is more dear to\\nthe American heart than health— one’s\\nown, that of others and more recently\\nthat of whoever happens to be the Presi\\ndent of the United States. Mr. Eisen\\nhower’s for example, has provided\\nmaterial for interminable discussion\\nand, it might be added incidentally,\\nfor warm congratulations at this\\nmoment.\\nSo it is that the two young men,\\nboth in their forties, who were com\\npeting last fall for the prize of White\\nHouse tenancy felt compelled to pro\\nduce something in the nature of a*\\ndoctor’s certificate that they were sound\\nof mind and body. It is, of course, a\\ngood thing to be so, and now that John\\nF.

Eisen\\nhower\\'s future role in politics\\nand in the councils of the Re\\npublican Party remains to be\\ndeveloped as he steps out\\nof the White House. Very\\ndefinitely, he leaves the presi\\ndential office .still a great\\nfigure in the minds of mil\\nlions of his countrymen. In\\nhis final press conference,\\nMr. Eisenhower disclosed he\\nfavors advancing the times\\nof presidential elections and\\npresidential inaugurations\\nwhich he will discuss fully at\\na later date. He has reached\\nthe conclusion, too, that the\\nTwenty-second amendment\\nto the Constitution, limiting a\\nPresident to two four-year\\nterms is wise. Further, he\\nstated that he will always be\\navailable for consultation if\\nthe leaders of the Republican\\nParty wish to confer with\\nhim.\\nIt seems quite clear, how\\never, that Mr. Eisenhower—\\nwho is probably to become\\nGen. Eisenhower again, re\\nverting to his old military\\ntitle, won as commander-in\\nchief of the Allied armies in\\nthe Second World War—will\\nnot follow in the footsteps of\\nhis immediate predecessor,\\nformer President Harry S.\\nTruman. Mr. Truman in 1956\\nand 1960 supported candi\\ndates of his own choice for his\\nparty’s presidential nomina\\ntion, but without success.\\nMr. Eisenhower gave his\\nblessing to the candidacy of\\nVice President Richard M.\\nNixon for the Republican\\npresidential nomination, but\\nnot strongly until it was clear\\nno other potential candidate\\nwas left in the field. That is,\\nuntil after Gov. Rockefeller\\nof New York had withdrawn\\nfrom the race. Even after the\\nGovernor’s announcement in\\nDecember, 1959, that he would\\nnot be a candidate, Mr. Ei\\nsenhower continued to limit\\nhis endorsement of Mr. Nixon\\nto praise of his services in\\nthe office of Vice President\\nand his own personal faith\\nin him.\\nFavors Earlier Schedule\\nA 8 a result of his experi\\nences in the presidential of\\nfice, Mr. Elsenhower is fa\\nvoring the idea of earlier\\npresidential elections and in\\naugurations. If such a plan\\nwere carried out, it would\\nrequire a constitutional\\namendment. He would not\\ngo back to the old lame\\nduck short sessions of Con\\ngress, in vogue before the\\nadoption of the Twentieth\\namendment. But he would\\ngive a new President at least\\n80 days to adjust to his new\\noffice, to draft his messages\\non the state of the Union,\\nhis budget message, and a\\nlegislative program, before\\nhe was forced to face the\\nCongress. Mr. Eisenhower’s\\npoint obviously is that the\\npresent system, under which\\na retiring President who does\\nnot leave office until 17 days\\nafter the new Congress has\\nassembled in Washington,\\nmust submit his message on\\nthe state of the Union and\\na budget message during that\\ninterval, knowing well that\\nMass Transit Planning\\nMany visitors to Washing\\nton for the inauguration will\\nbe appalled to find that\\nWashington is not as clean,\\nbeautiful, and dignified as it\\nused to be. They will find\\nthat Washington rapidly is\\nbecoming another Los An\\ngeles. We, too, have an air\\npollution problem. We, too,\\nare tearing down homes,\\nschools, and commercial\\nbuildings to make way for\\nparking facilities, freeways,\\nand bridge approaches for the\\nexclusive use of pneumatic\\ntired vehicles. Moreover, our\\nprincipal mass transit system\\nis deteriorating as bumpy\\nsmoke-belching diesel buses\\nreplace smooth, clean, com\\nfortable streetcars.\\nThe deterioration of the\\nNation’s Capital will proceed\\nat an accelerating pace if\\nCongress and the Executive\\nBranch follow the advice of\\nhighway and traffic engin\\neers, whose mission seems to\\nbe to perpetuate and increase\\nthe jobs of such engineers;\\nwho think in terms of motor\\nvehicles instead of human\\nbeings; and who promote an\\nendless series of projects that,\\ninstead of solving our trans\\nportation problems, greatly\\ncomplicate, delay, and in\\ncrease the cost of electric\\nrailway rapid transit con\\nstruction and operation.\\nIn Washington, as else\\nwhere. highway and traffic\\nplanners are dominating\\ngeneral-purpose urban and\\nregional planning, with the\\nresult that mass transit, in\\nstead of being used to help\\nguide the directions of pop\\nulation movement, patterns\\nof growth, and the character\\nof economic development, is\\nexpected to serve merely as\\nan overflow transportation\\nfacility, with rapid transit to\\nbe built only as a last resort.\\nAs evidenced by a recent\\ntalk by Washington’s high\\nway and traffic director be\\nfore the Citizens’ Advisory\\nCouncil, many highway and\\ntraffic engineers try to delay\\nrapid transit construction\\nand promote highway con\\nstruction by conveniently\\noverlooking the disadvanta\\nges of concentration on high\\nways, and overlooking the\\nadvantages of railways. Ac\\ntually, a good transit system\\nin a large metropolitan area\\nneeds both railway and high\\nway transit vehicles. Those\\nwho wish to delay rail rapid\\ntransit construction like to\\nuse New York City’s recent\\nhis successor will then be\\ncalled upon to send his own\\nrecommendations to Con\\ngress, as well as his own\\nviews on the state of the\\nUnion, contained in his in\\naugural address. In the\\nopinion of Mr. Elsenhower,\\nthis is inefficient and in\\neffective procedure.\\nRole Up to Party\\nFormer President Truman\\nhas never taken himself out\\nof the picture in his own po\\nlitical party, or out of poli\\ntics. He has disliked the\\nidea of being an elder states\\nman describing an elder\\nstatesman as a dead politi\\ncian. Mr. Eisenhower de\\nclined flatly at his final press\\nconference to compare his\\nown future political activi\\nties with those of , Mr. Tru\\nman. Indeed, the part Mr.\\nEisenhower will play depends\\nin large part on what the\\nG. O. P. wants him to do, as\\nexpressed by party leaders\\nand rank and file. He is\\nnot expected to consider him\\nself titular leader of the Re\\npublican Party—a role that\\nis usually assigned to the\\nmost recent presidential can\\ndidate, whether he has been\\nsuccessful or has lost the\\nelection. In fact, quite the\\ncontrary. But he will stand\\nready to advise his party and\\nto work for it.\\nThe outgoing President, at\\nhis last press conference, set\\nhimself firmly against a\\nrepeal of the presidential two\\nterm amendment to the Con\\nstitution—the Twenty-second\\namendment. At first inclined\\nto doubt the wisdom of that\\namendment, which was pro\\nposed by Congress and rati\\nfied by the necessary number\\nof States after conclusion of\\nthe Franklin D. Roosevelt\\nregime, Mr. Eisenhower has\\ncome to the conclusion it is\\na wise provision, a tradition\\nviolated only once since\\nthe days of the first Presi\\ndent, George Washington.\\nAlthough he did not say it\\nIn so many words, there lies\\nin an unrestricted number of\\npresidential terms an op\\nportunity of a self-perpetuat\\ning dictatorship, a danger\\nthat should be avoided. The\\nargument against the two\\nterm amendment has been\\nthat the American people\\nshould be free to make use\\nof the services of any citizen\\nas Chief Executive for as\\nlong as they desire. This\\nargues the indispensability of\\nan individual in a country of\\nnearly 200 million souls. The\\nTwenty-second amendment\\ndoes not now appear in any\\ndanger of repeal, although a\\nnew, youthful and vigorous\\nPresident, John F. Kennedy\\nof Massachusetts, is taking\\nover. Much will depend upon\\nthe success of his administra\\ntion as to any real movement\\nfor a return to the situation\\nwhich permitted an election\\nof the late President Roose\\nvelt for a fourth term. No\\nwar in which this country\\nhas been involved has lasted\\nmore than four years—and a\\nwar today might be limited\\nin time to days or weeks or\\nmonths, because of the weap\\nons that have been developed.\\nexperience as typical of sub\\nway construction costs; they\\nfrequently ignore the lower\\ncosts in Washington, Boston,\\nPhiladelphia, Toronto, and\\nNewark, N.

No. More than half the\\n18,000 veterinarians in this\\ncountry are in general prac\\ntice—that is, they treat all\\ntypes of animals. About 10\\nper cent treat small animals\\nonly; less than 5 per cent\\nspecialize in the treatment of\\ncattle, horses, poultry, sheep\\nor swine. The rest are in\\nteaching, research, govern\\nment programs, etc.\\nQ. Who started the “Wel\\ncome Wagon” idea?—C. V.\\nA. The Welcome Wagon\\nService originated in Mem\\nphis, Tenn., in 1928. It is\\nsaid to have been inspired\\nby the old custom of greet\\nting wagon trains with bas\\nkets of provisions, with the\\nidea of attracting settlers\\nto new communities. Thomas\\nW. Briggs originated the\\npresent service which now\\noperates in hundreds of\\ncities.'},\n",

The nostalgia was what was interesting.\\n\"Tell us,\" a reporter asked, \"how you are finding\\nlife in retirement now. Do you sometimes feel that you\\'d\\nlike to be back in the White House taking up the burdens\\nthere? I know you are very busy. . ..\"\\n\"Well, I\\'m very busy, that\\'s correct,\" replied the\\nretired five-star general. Then the famous Eisenhower\\nbrow went into its furrow. \"But I have mixeti/feelings.\\nI think each of us has his portion of ego and his confi\\ndence that he could do some of these things pretty well,\\nand I will say this—at least one night I dreamed that\\nthe Twenty-second Amendment (barring a third term)\\nhad been repealed (pause for laughter) and it wasn t wholly\\na nightmare\"—more laughter.\\nThe furrow smoothed and the grin flashed.\\n* * *\\n*lt has long been my judgment that the real threat\\nto liberty in this republic will come not from any sudden,\\ncalculated onslaught. Rather, the threat to our liberties\\nwill be primarily found in a steady erosion of self-reliant\\ncitizenship, and in excessive power concentration resulting\\nfrom the lodging of more and more decisions in an ever\\ngrowing Federal bureaucracy,\" Gen Eisenhower said. He\\ncited the following as evidence:\\nThe President\\'s request for executive power to modify\\nincome taxes at times; his proposal that the executive have\\nauthority \"to finance . . . large-scale emergency public\\nworks by diversion of funds dedicated to other purposes,\"\\nthe Administration request for \"sweeping and repressive\"\\nauthority over agriculture; the proposal for a Department\\nof Urban Affairs, which would take over \"a whole host\\nof state and local responsibilities,\" and the proposal \"to\\ndilute the independence of the Federal Reserve Board by\\nPresidential appointment of its chairman.\"\\nTwist\\n(Continued from Back Page)\\nThe former President answered his own doubts in\\nhis Kansas speech by saying: \"We are about to see a\\nRenaissance in American pride in America.\"\\nIn many ways that renaissance has already begun.\\nIt comes not frum mere nationalist pride but pride in\\nwhat the country stands for. What was wrong was a case\\nof power corrupting—or more properly materialism cor\\nrupting. And the correction that has now begun is of\\nthe best kind—self-correction.\\n* * •\\nDespite the spread of salacious literature and Holly\\nwood\\'s attempt to sell the most smirksome titillation,\\nthere is a countertide now running. Young college stu\\ndents have begun to criticize the commercialization of\\nsex. New ventures in the erotic magazine field have\\nbeen mercilessly panned by the \"sophisticates\" to whom\\nthey were supposed to appeal.\\n* * *\\nMade aware of the danger* Americans put behind\\nthem the excesses of monopoly, city bossism, speak-easy\\nliving, Isolationism, and McCarthyism. They are now\\nstruggling to control labor union monopolism, gangsterism,\\nnew forms of government corruption, false advertising,\\nstructural unemployment caused* by automation, and de\\nlinquency caused by the wrenching of family life in a\\nworld changed almost overnight from placid rural to\\nfrantic megalopolis, from personal craftsmanship to dis\\nembodied IBM robotry.\\nsee\\nDETROIT TRIBUNE, SATURDAY, MAY 26, 1962\\n9'},\n",

Mr. Webb\\nsaid weather satellites are\\nproviding valuable advance in\\nformation on storms and that\\ncommunications satellite re\\nsearch holds promise of less\\ncostly and more efficient com\\nmunications between contin\\nents. The report was written\\nbefore the successful launch\\ning of Telstar yesterday.\\nThrough data from the\\nflights of American astronauts,\\nMr. Webb said, “we are learn\\ning how well a man caji pilot\\na spacecraft, how he can ad\\njust to the weightlessness and\\nother stresses of space and:\\nwhat he can observe to add to\\nthe information recorded by\\nelectronic sensors.”\\nConcluding his letter to the\\nPresident, Mr. Webb said:\\nI “It Is clear that space re\\nr search will add immeasurably\\ns to man\\'s knowledge of science.\\nI technology, his own planet, the\\n1 universe, and possibly the\\n:, origin of life itself.

Kinsell, di\\nrector of the Institute for Me\\ntabolic Research in Oakland,\\nCalif., it said in part:\\n“A few years ago some of us\\nwere asked by the Food and\\nDrug Administration as well\\nas by the Committee on Drugs\\nof the American Medical Asso\\nciation for an opinion with re\\ngard to the drug triparanol\\n(MER/29). The chief question\\nwas whether it should be re\\nleased for general clinical use\\nby physicians.\\n“I stated, in totally unequi\\nvocal terms, that I felt that\\nthe drug should not be re\\nleased; that it was a potential\\nly dangerous drug until proven\\notherwise, and that for a long\\ntime it should be used only\\nunder the most carefully con\\ntrolled conditions.\\n“Other ‘experts’ gave near\\nly identical opinions.\\n“The Food and Drug people\\nchose to disregard this advice\\nand permitted the manufac\\nturer to make the drug avail\\nable for general clinical use.\\nAs you are perhaps aware, the\\ndrug was withdrawn from the\\nmarket within the last few\\nmonths because of disastrous\\nconsequences attendant upon\\nits use.\\n“All of this could have been\\navoided.”\\nThe drug was released in\\nApril, 1960.\\nLater, after reports of human\\ncataracts in users of MER\\'29\\nhad been circulated, four re\\nsearchers set out to see if this\\ncould have been shown in ani\\nmals.\\nThey found that in their\\nmarkers they vandalized. Justice of the Peace\\nHarold Hennessy, who imposed sentence, with\\nheld the boys’ names.—AP Wirephoto.\\nafter-the-fact tests, 34 of 38\\ntest rats did indeed develop\\n“cataractous changes within 10\\nweeks after triparanol feeding\\nwas started.\"\\nBefore FDA’s release of the\\ndrug, the agency’s Division of\\nPharmacology had also cited\\n“severe toxicity in some of the\\nanimal testing,” according to\\npreviously reported testimony\\nbefore the subcommittee, but\\nthe division’s objections were\\noverridden.\\n390,0 M Used MER/29\\nAn estimated 300,000 patients\\nused the drug. According to one\\nestimate to the subcommittee,\\nmore than 1,000 persons\\' in\\njuries may be linked to it.\\nAs side effects of the drug\\nwere reported, members of the\\nFDA staff became convinced\\nthe drug should be taken off\\nthe market.\\nIt took a long fight to get\\nthe drug company to agree,\\nhowever. (Subsequent drug\\nlegislation gives FDA more\\npower in getting such drugs off\\nthe market.)\\nThe Merrell Co. could argue,\\nin the case of the cataracts,\\nthat these could have been\\ncaused by other conditions,\\nsome linked to aging.\\nAccording to an account for\\nthe subcommittee by Dr. T. J.\\nKirby of the Mayo Clinic, sev\\neral cases of side effects had\\nbeen reported by the clinic to\\nMerrell and much correspond\\nence went back and forth about\\nthem.\\nChild Develops Cataracts\\nThen, on March 21, 1962, Dr.\\nKirby said, cataracts were\\nfound to have developed in a\\n6-year-old child, an unusual\\ncase being treated with MER/\\n29 for high cholesterol and a\\nfat metabolism problem.

WILDER, Director, Delaware Game & Fish Commission\\n/\\n- /\\n*\\nThe White-tailed Deer, Delaware\\'s only big game animal, is increasing in\\nnumbers in our state as it is all across our country. Paradoxically, the white\\ntailed is multiplying almost within shouting distance of expanding suburban\\ndevelopments. In spite of our heavy population, Delaware has the enviable\\nrecord of no fatalities during the seven shot-gun seasons for taking any deer.\\nSince Delaware is about as hilly as a pool table, the short-range shotgun\\nand rifled slug (also the pumpkin ball) is the legal weapon for the hunt. How\\never, never sell short the killing power of the rifled slug at 50 or 75 y\\'ards, for\\nit is a dependable big game weapon capable of penetrating a pine at least eight\\ninches. Fact is, at close range it is superior to a high-powered bullet. It is\\nlikely to be deflected by heavy underbrush.\\nDelaware hunters will probably bring down about 600 \"white-tails\" in prime\\ncondition during the eighth shotgun season on January 12 and 13. 1962. Hunters\\nare urged to practice safe handling of firearms.

It is far worse than I\\'ve been able to reveal\\nin a few words.\\nThe treaty outlines a three-phase disarmament\\nplan. All parties to the treaty would agree to do\\naway, for all practical purposes, with their entire\\nmilitary forces and all armaments within a period\\nof something over six years. The only military\\nforce, as such, remaining would exist only to be\\nplaced at the disposal of the United Nations com\\nmand. This would be called a \"Peace Force.\" As\\nthe treaty puts it, \\'oy the final stage of the plan:\\nParties to the Treaty would complete the reduc\\ntion of their force levels, disband systems of re\\nserve forces, cause to be disbanded organizational\\narrangements comprising and supporting their\\nnational military establishment, and terminate the\\nemployment of civilian personnel associated with\\nthe foregoing.\" There are vague provisions for\\nretaining armaments for forces which parties to\\nthe treaty would be permitted to retain to main\\ntain internal order and protect the personal se\\ncurity of their citizens. Dictator states don\\'t dare\\npermit an armed citizenry. It is likely that the\\nadministrators of the proposed treaty would per\\nmit United States citizens to have weapons?\\nSome members of Congress have since indicated\\nthat this treaty does not include sporting weapons.\\nIt doesn\\'t mention sporting weapons specifically—\\nnor does it exclude them. It would be exceedingly\\nnaive to expect specific mention of sporting wea\\npons. However, if you read the treaty, you can\\nsee that these can easily be included after the\\ntreaty is put into force. But from that time on an\\naroused American public won\\'t mean much. The\\ntreaty does refer to all armaments, with certain\\nexceptions for what is apparently a police force.\\nSubject to agreed requirements for non-nuclear\\narmaments of agreed types for national forces re\\nquired to maintain internal order and protect the\\npersonal security of citizens, the Parties to the\\nTreaty would eliminate all armaments remaining\\nat their disposal at the end of Stage II.\\ntold that sporting weapons are not included in the\\ntreaty terms. Then try to get sporting weapons\\n(carefully defined) excluded and see how far you\\nget.\\nBy VEJE BROWN\\nThe Grim Facts About Disarmament\\n. i\\nIs the American Government about to sell the\\nSecond Amendment (right to bear arms) for a\\ndoubtful peace? Here are the grim, hidden facts—\\nAre the 30 million private American gun owners\\na threat to peace and security in this country—or\\nthe world?\\nYes, under certain conditions this is entirely\\npossible. There is little doubt that this possibility\\nof a threat was fully intended by those states, of\\nthe original 13, which insisted on adoption of the\\nfirst ten amendments to the United States consti\\ntution. We can be forever thankful that some of\\nthe original states were very suspicious of un\\nbridled government power and demanded that\\nthese amendments, later to be known as our Bill\\nof Rights, be passed as soon as possible after the\\nestablishment of the government to be formed\\nunder the Constitution.\\nOf course our response to the words \"peace\" and\\nsecurity\" depends on our understanding of these\\ntwo terms. Peace and security do not mean the\\nsame to all people. To the growing cult of mild\\nness, peace means simply freedom trom the threat\\nof war. We can have this brand of peace any time\\nwe seek it. All we have to do is surrender our\\nsovereignty and our capacity for self-defense, and\\nthereby throw ourselves on the mercy of the pow\\ners that be. Security, to some people means being\\ntaken care of from cradle to grave. These people\\ngenerally reason that an all-powerful Federal\\nGovernment is best qualified to take on this re\\nsponsibility. We can get this kind of security at\\nany time by merely surrendering our liberties.\\nThose who seek the power to impose their will on\\nthe majority are only too happy to assume full\\nresponsibility for the peace and security of others.\\nNaturally, those who relinquish their respons\\nibility are expected to surrender their capacity to\\ndisturb the \"peace.\" Not too long ago we had an\\noffer to \"bury us,\" and I\\'m quite sure it was in\\ntended that this service be rendered entirely free\\nof charge.\\nThe legislative attempts at outlawing guns can\\nbe dealt with by an alert people, and wrong-way\\nlegislation can be corrected; but there is an en\\ntirely new threat looming big in the form of a dis\\narmament treaty proposed by our government.\\nIf accepted, it would leave us powerless to act.\\nThe decisions relative to whether or not we can\\nhave guns and the conditions under which we\\nwill be permitted to use them—if at all—will not\\neven be made by our government. These decisions\\nwill be made by representatives from various\\ncountries, including enemy powers. It also appears\\nthat we would have foreign inspectors in this\\ncountry to see that the conditions imposed on us\\nare enforced. Our only recourse as a nation will\\nbe through the World Court. The World Court\\nconsists of 15 judges, of which one may be an\\nAmerican. The other 14 will be from various\\ncountries, including enemy countries. Can we\\nexpect them to be sympathetic to our cause? Does\\nthis sound like a pretty package? It is not exag\\ngeration. Unless you have studied the provisions\\nU. N. Peace Force\\' Would Rule World\\nLegion Probers Find Jokers\\nThe Chas. M. DeBremond Post No. 28 of the\\nAmerican Legion, Roswell, N. M., last year created\\na Committee to examine the Arms Control and\\nDisarmament Act—Public Law 87-297. Its chair\\nman is James P. Risley, Lt. Gen. USMC (Ret).\\nThe committee was set up at the time the U. S.\\nmade its disarmament proposals at Geneva, based\\non the State Department plan as submitted to the\\nUnited Nations by President Kennedy and out\\nlined in State Department publication No. 7277—\\nFreedom From War.\" Its report states:\\n\"The objectives of the Geneva proposals, to\\nwhich the U.S.S.R. must subscribe to put this law\\ninto effect, is not disarmament but rather the arm\\ning of the United Nations and the disarming of the\\nmember nations. From the Communist point of\\nview, this is of supreme importance. They know\\ntheir superiority in political warfare, just as they\\nare fully aware of their irremedial inferiority in\\nmilitary strength and capacity.

The\\norganisms are commonly found\\non the skin of a carrier or in\\nthe throat. These organisms may\\nreadily gain entrance to such\\nfoods as cream puffs, cream-fil\\nled cakes, cooked ham, chicken\\ngravy, sausage, milk, cheese,\\netc. If these foods are left at\\nroom temperature for several\\nhours, the bacteria find ideal\\nconditions for multiplication and\\nfor the bacteria growth to devel\\nop so as to withstand boiling\\nor cooking for 30 to F0 minutes.\\nThe consumption of infected iood\\ncauses the onset of illness gen\\nerally within two or three hours.\\nTvnical symptoms include\\nnaus\\nea, vomiting, diarrhea, and ab\\ndom inal cramps.

Yet that\\ndocument itself prescribes\\nthe methods of amendment,\\nand the fact is that the Con\\nstitution has oeen amended\\n22 times since the founding\\nof the Republic.\\nMr. Kennedy has a right to\\noppose particular amend\\nments that he doesn’t like.\\nBut he will be regarded as\\nout of bounds when he de\\nclares that people who rant\\nto amend the Constitution\\nare not “defending” the Con\\nstitution, particularly when\\ntheir purpose in the instance\\nreferred to is to secure the\\nadoption of specific amend\\nments that will preserve and\\ndefend the basic orinctples\\nof the Constitution itself\\nagainst usurpation and abuse\\nof power.\\nThe President’s words, as\\nthey appear in the White\\nHouse transcript of Wednes\\nday\\'s news conference, were\\nas follows:\\n“It has always seemed to\\nme remarkable that those\\npeople and organizations who\\nare founded In order to de\\nfend the Constitution should\\nseek to change it, and par\\nticularly to change it in such\\na basic way, either to affect\\nthe power of the Congress to\\namend the Constitution and\\nput severe limitations upon\\nthe Congress—which, after\\nall. represents the people\\nmost directly—or otherwise\\nto affect the power of the\\nSupreme Court, which is one\\nof the most important pro\\ntections of individual rights\\nand one of the most impor\\ntant securities we have for\\nan amicable settlement of\\ndisputes, and which, after\\nall, became such a signifi\\ncant part of our American\\nconstitutional development\\nunder the leadership of an\\nAmerican who is usually\\nheralded—Mr. John Mar-\\nDORIS FLEESON\\nSome Didn\\'t Come to Dinner\\nG. 0.

So I would think that\\nthe efforts will come to noth\\ning, and I will be glad when\\nthey do not.”\\nBut Mr. Kennedy failed to\\ntell his audience that the\\ncurrent movement to amend\\ncertain parts of the Con\\nstitution has grown out of\\nthe controversy over who\\nshould apportion the voting\\ndistricts in a State and other\\ninstances of alleged usurpa\\ntion of power by the Su\\npreme Court—which has no\\nright to amend the Consti\\ntution. The proper methods\\nat present for making\\nchanges in the Constitution\\nare specified in the docu\\nment, itself.\\nMr. Kennedy apparently\\nhasn’t looked into the pro\\nposals which have been made\\nrecently by various organiza\\ntions of citizens and which\\nalready have received the\\nsupport of several State leg\\nislatures.\\nFirst of all. it is im\\nportant to emphasize some\\nthing which the general pub\\nlic may not realize and which\\nperhaps high officials in our\\nGovernment have brushed\\naside namely, that the\\nConstitution can be amended\\nin other ways than by a two\\nthirds vote of both Houses\\nof Congress and ratification\\nby three-fourths of the State\\nlegislatures. It can be done\\ndirectly by the people.\\nFor Article V of the\\nConstitution provides that\\nCongress, “on the application\\nof the legislatures of two\\nthirds of the several States,\\nshall call a convention for\\nproposing amendments,\\nwhich, in either case, shall be\\nvalid to all intents and pur\\nposes, as part of this Consti\\ntution, when ratified by the\\nlegislatures of three-fourths\\nof the several States, or. by\\nconventions in three-fourths\\nthereof, as the one or the\\nother mode of ratification\\nmay be proposed by the\\nCongress.”\\nIt so happens that the fa\\nmous Prohibition Amend\\nment was repealed and\\nthe Twenty-first Amendment\\nsubstituting for it was adopt\\ned without being submitted\\nto the legislatures of the\\nStates. It was ratified instead\\nby conventions in two-thirds\\nof the States summoned by\\nthe State legislatures. It took\\nonly nine months to accom-\\ngood notices and Inhale thtir\\napplause.\\nA serious and potentially di\\nvisive Goldwater candidacy\\nseems inevitable unless and\\nuntil Republicans soon find\\na number of broad channels\\nthrough which to funnel\\ntheir obvious vigor and con\\nfidence. As the showdowns\\napproach, G. O. P. emphasis\\nis still on the negative, both\\nas to issues and people.\\nThe most extraordinary as\\npect of their conversations is\\ntheir omission of even a pass\\ning glance at their qualified\\nSenators, except for the spe\\ncial case of Senator Gold\\nwater. The contrast to the\\nDemocrats during the similar\\nperiod prior to their 1960 tri\\numph is striking.\\nThe Senate then had a vir\\ntual monoply of the party\\'s\\npresidential aspirants, and\\nevery Democrat had a place\\nto go. Majority Leader John\\nson was the white hope of\\nconservatives, Senator Hum\\nphrey of the liberals.

The first would\\nclarify the language of Arti\\ncle V and simplify the proce\\ndure so that, whenever two\\nthirds of the State legisla\\ntures submitted identical\\ntexts of a particular amend\\nment to be voted on and it\\nwas then approved by three\\nfourths of the State legisla\\ntures, the amendment would\\nbe automatically certified as\\nhaving been adopted.\\nThe second amendment\\nproposed would preclude\\nFederal consideration of\\nmatters relating to reappor\\ntionment of State legisla\\ntures.\\nThe third proposes the\\ncreation of a \"Court of the\\nUnion” which would have\\nthe final say in matters of\\nconfuting State - Federal\\nclaims of power under the\\nConstitution.\\nThese three amendments\\nwould, of course, be valid\\nonly if adopted under either\\nof the two existing methods\\nnow prescribed in the Con\\nstitution.

Yet Mr.\\nKennedy, with a sweeping\\ndenunciation that reveals he\\nhasn’t really studied the\\nproblem, puts the presiden\\ntial finger of discredit on\\nthem as somehow having an\\nimproper attitude toward\\namending the Constitution,\\neven though the method they\\nare using to make the\\nchange is specifically pre\\nscribed in the Constitution\\nitself.\\n(Copyright. 1!»S3.

But, in\\nfact, the space program has\\nbecome a fief for the rotari\\nans of this world while the\\nmost distinguished members\\nof the scientific community\\nare indifferent if not hostile\\n—a state of affairs apt to do\\nharm both to the program\\nand the scientific community.\\nThe rotarian character of\\nthe program is depressingly\\nobvious. Its public purpose\\nis crude—victory in a race to\\nthe moon. Its chief political\\nbackers have been famous\\nwheeler-dealers Lyndon\\nJohnson and the late Senator\\nRobert 8. Kerr. It is run by\\nmanagerial types oriented\\ntoward the areospace indus\\ntry. Its face is the ballyhoo\\nsection of the Luce publica\\ntions; its voice, the soporific\\nhomilies of Col. Glenn.\\nNo less obvious is the dis\\ntance taken by the scientific\\nestablishment. Os the 30 or\\n40 distinguished men who hold\\nthe prize professorships at\\nHarvard. Yale, Columbia,\\nPrinceton, Chicago and Cali\\nfornia. not one is identified\\nwith—much less actively en\\ngaged in—the space program.\\nIn private, many have voiced\\nsharp criticisms of the pro\\ngram—notably, the man on\\nthe moon, or Apollo, project.\\nTheir views have been echoed\\nby the most thoughtful and\\nsensistive members of the\\npress and the Congress. Sen\\nator Fulbright, for example,\\nin the Clayton lectures last\\nTHE EVENING STAR\\nWsiAingten, D. C., friday, May 10, 1903\\nweek, asked whether space\\nexploration \"is a more impor\\ntant and pressing national\\nneed than other needs such\\nas employment and education\\nand urban renewal.”\\nNo doubt the scientific es\\ntablishment has its reasons\\nfor standing aloof. It has\\ncome to grief in the past\\nwhen it lent prestige to men\\nmore keen for power than\\ntruth. It has been systemati\\ncally bypassed by the space\\nagency on major decisions as\\nto the purpose, pace and de\\nsign of the program. On one\\nimportant recent decision, in\\nfact, NASA would not even\\nwait for the results of a study\\nby the President’s Scientific\\nAdviser. ♦\\nBut the way to alter the\\nbalance in the space pro\\ngram is not to stand outside\\nand snipe. The Nation is\\ncommitted, and it will not be\\nmuch moved by generalized\\ncharges likening the pro\\ngram to an exercise in \"leaf\\nraking.\" What can be altered\\nis the relative emphasis on\\nprojects within the program.\\nBut that can only be ac\\ncomplished through detailed\\n1 comment by thoughtful sci\\nentists who have become\\nversed in the program through\\nwork on the Inside. With\\nout such statements, indeed,\\nthe public has no standard\\nfor gauging the program ex\\nl cept the standard of reach\\ning the moon. Only those\\ni on the bandwagon, in other\\nwords, can shape its course,\\nI and Indicate other directions\\nit might be taking.\\nParticipation by the scien\\ntific establishment, more\\nover, can do more than im\\nprove the present quality of\\nA-9\\nthe program. It can decisive\\nly affect the enduring char\\nacter of the space effort.\\nFor whether this country\\nreaches the moon first, as\\nseems increasingly possible,\\nor whether Russia takes the\\ncigar, the winning of the race\\nwill spell the end of the\\npresent justification for the\\nspace program. The oppor\\ntunity to go beyond the moon\\nwill beckon, and the door will\\nbe open to a new and more\\nsensible rationale—a ration\\nale that might include as one\\nof its important components,\\nthe pursuit of knowledge for\\nits own sake. The more so, as\\nthe handful of first-rate\\nyoung scientists who are in\\nthe program report that\\nspace study affords unique\\nclues to some of the classic\\nhumanistic problems that\\nhave always intrigued the\\nmost serious men of science:\\nProblems such as the origin\\nof life, for example, or of the\\nsolar system.\\nTo be sure there is some\\nthing seedy about using the\\nspace program as a cover\\nfor serious scientific inquiry.\\nStill the atmosphere of the\\naffluent society offers only\\nrare openings to direct public\\nenergies and resources to\\npurposes that are not vain.\\nFor the most eminent scien\\ntists to overlook the power\\nful grip of space on the pub\\nlic imagination would be to\\nforego an almost unique op\\nportunity for the advance\\nment of science.

Counsel Thomas E.\\nHarris charged here that spon\\nsors of a so-called “right-to\\nwork* constitutional amendment\\nin Oklahoma are out “to de\\nstroy unions and collective bar\\ngaining\" as part of a “total\\nwar\" on the labor movement.\\nIt’s not just a “minor skir\\nmish’,’ he warned the Oklaho- j\\nma State AFL-CIO convention, i\\n“You must win it,” he said.\\nHarris told the delegates that i\\nit is “surely not a coincidence\" j\\nthat employers who are behind\\nthe “work\" campaign are those\\nwho are “unwilling to deal with\\nunions at all.\"\\nHe noted that employers “who\\nrecognize unions, and who ex\\ncept to keep on recognizing\\nthem, show little interest in\\n‘right-to-work’ agitation.”\\nThe AFL-CIO attorney said\\nthe choice of Oklahoma as the\\nnext major battleground for\\n“right-to-work” was made by\\n“the professional war mongers\\nof the class war,” by people j\\nwho, in order “to collect money\\nand make a living for them\\nselves,” are willing and in fact\\neager to “show discord between\\nand employer associations.\\nWithin 24 hours, Joint Council j\\nManager Charles S. Zimmer- j\\nman said, 44 of the 80 tardy j\\njobbers had settled the new\\nrates for each garment and all\\nbut about 20 had complied with\\nthe contract by the second day. i\\nSome 11,000 workers returned\\nto 180 shops after a day of\\nbeing off the job.\\nThere was no picketing, ex\\ncept for one day at one shop\\nin Pennsylvania. Other shops\\naffected are in New York, New\\nJersey, Connecticut, Massachu\\nsetts, Rhode Island and Dela\\nware.\\nThe .stoppage involved dress\\noperators employed by some 80\\njobbers who “farm out” work\\nunder contract to 400 shops\\nscattered around New York and\\nnearby states. Under the agree\\nment with the union, contrac\\ntors are required to pay piece\\nwork rates negotiated every\\nseason for every style of gar\\nment. The custom has been\\nby the jobber and the union in\\nNew York City.\\nZimmerman had warned all\\nassociations Feb. 7 to notify\\n| their members that ILGWTU\\nworkers are not obligated to\\nI work on garments where the\\nj piecework rate has not been\\nworked out with the union.\\nBirmingham Still\\nGrapples With\\nPark Closing\\nProblems\\nBirmingham, Ala.

People who be\\nlieve in unions at all want\\nstrong unions.”\\nGranting that many people\\nwho vote for “right-to-work”\\nlaws are “sincere and decent,”\\nHarris probed into their reasons\\nfor supporting such laws. He\\nsaid:\\n“I think that one main reason\\nis that they are nostalgic for a\\nsimpler form of society, where j\\npeople are not so dependent on >\\neach other, and on government,\\nas they are these days. Many\\npeople look back to an earlier\\nday when, supposedly at least,\\nfarmers owned their own small\\nfarms and marketed their own\\ncrops, and a shoemaker made\\nshoes and sold them to his\\nneighbors.\\n“Some of the people who\\ncherish this atavistic vision of\\nthe good life are probably them\\nselves farmers who vote for\\ngovernment acreage controls,\\nreceive federal payments, and\\'\\nmarket their crops through\\nfarm cooperatives, which en\\njoy special exemption from the\\nanti-trust laws.”\\nHarris noted that “whether\\nfortunately or unfortunately”\\ntheir concept of society does not\\ncover “the realities of life in\\nan industrial society in 20th\\nCentury America.”\\nIndustrialization, he observed\\n“will continue at an increasing\\npace, and huge corporations will\\ngrow huger.”\\n-o\\nPATRONIZE\\nOUR ADVERTISERS\\nBIG REFRESHMENT VALUE!\\nafter\\nyou pour...\\nthere’s still\\nlots more!\\nKING SIZE COKE\\n»r«. »r or», •: •\\nGET VALUE...LIFT...REFRESHMENT, TOO!\\nNOW!

MIKE MANSFIELD\\nMontana received $2.10 in federal funds for every $1.00\\nit paid to the federal government in fiscal year 1962.\\nThe growing importance of federal expenditures to the\\nState\\'s economy was highlighted in figures just released by\\nthe nine Cabinet-level departments and four independent agen\\ncies operating in Montana. These agencies dispensed a grand\\ntotal of $346,321,832 in goods and services, while the Internal\\nRevenue Service was collecting $162,892,000 in taxes from\\nindividuals and businesses.\\nThe ratio of expenditures to re\\nceipts was roughly 2.1 to 1, top\\nping by a considerable n\\\\argin the\\n1961 ratio of 1.8 to 1, The figures\\nreleased by the agencies included\\nall expenditures-not only in di\\nrect grants, but for salaries, goods\\nand services.\\nMilitary spending accounted fo\\'r\\nthe greatest part of the increase. The\\nDefense Department expended a rec\\nord $135.5 million, an increase of\\nnearly $60 million over the previous\\nyear. The bulk of this was devoted\\nto expansion of air base facilities in\\nGreat Falls and Glasgow and con\\ntinued construction of Minuteman\\nmissile sites across central Montana.\\nAGRICULTURE SECOND\\nLARGEST\\nMontana\\'s second largest federal\\ncustomer was the Department of Ag\\nriculture, which spent $76.7 million\\nin its multiple programs.

Owen Hurd, WPPSS mana\\nger, recalled that electric company\\nofficials opposed Grand Coulee Dam\\nbecause \"there\\'s be no one to use it\\nexcept jack-rabbits.\\nPerce power will be needed \"as quick\\nly as it can be brought on the line.\\n* Levy\\'s final point—that the pub\\nlic group couldn\\'t begin building Nez\\n\\' *\\nby Levy, that may help the five pow\\ner commissioners redeem President\\nKennedy\\'s 2-year-old promise.\\nPerce \"without a long drawn-out con\\ntest with hostile local authorities\"—\\nparticularly incensed WPPSS offi\\ncials.\\n\"This gratuitous suggestion-for\\nwhich there\\'s no support in the\\nrecord-can only encourage pri\\nvate power companies to increase\\nlitigation threats to thwart public\\ndevelopment,\" said Radin.

That is a good\\nlaw, but it will become practi\\ncally a dead letter if your House\\nBill No. 391 is passed.\\nYou gave the reason in last\\nweek’s column. In your own\\nwords: “No county government,\\nno matter how much it may\\nwant to preserve open spaces,\\nhas the money to buy the de\\nvelopment rights of more than\\na tiny fraction of the hundreds\\nof square miles of farm land\\nwithin its boundaries.” The\\ncounty probably couldn’t afford\\nto buy the development rights\\nfor more than a few hundred\\nacres a year. At that rate, be\\nfore long, the whole county will\\nbe covered with urbran sprawl\\nand we shall see very few green,\\nopen spaces permanently pre\\nserved for our enjoyment and\\nthat of our children.\\nTherefore, the County needs\\nto get land-owners to donate\\ndevelopment rights or to sell\\nthem at moderate prices. How?\\nBy offering the land-owner a\\ntax reduction in exchange for\\nagreement not to develop his\\nland. Farmers who really want\\nto keep on farming would be\\nglad to make this exchange.\\nCountry clubs, golf courses,\\ncommunity swimming pools,\\nand other holders of open land\\nmight do the same thing.\\nBut your Bill 391 would take\\naway the incentive for land\\nowners to make such agree\\nments to keep their land open\\nbecause it just hands the land\\nowners big tax reductions on a\\nsilver platter without any bene\\nfit being given back to the coun\\nty-\\nAmendments 13 and 14 were\\nsold to the voters at the last\\nelection on the basis that any\\nlaws enacted under them would\\npreserve open spaces and “Save\\nOur Countryside.” Since you\\nand Senator Northrop, and Mrs.\\nCook and Mr. Woodward, were\\nleaders in this campaign of the\\nMontgomery County Committee\\nfor Open Spaces, we call upon\\nersburg, Supreme Representative; Ira Whit\\ntington, Grand Prelate; Edward M.

For this reason we wired\\nSenator Northrop and yourself\\nurgently requesting public hear\\nings before his Senate commit\\ntee and before the Montgomery\\nCounty Delegation.\\nThe Citizens Committee for\\nFair Taxation urges amend\\nments to provide that land in\\nMontgomery County will only\\nget reduced assessments below\\nfull value if the development\\nrights are conveyed to a public\\nagency.

For it\\nis mainly a war between those\\nwho believe in sound policies\\nand those who advocate un*\\nsound policies in government.\\nThe margin of victory—only\\nfive votes augurs trouble\\nfor the future. Not all those\\nwho voted with the radicals\\nthis time would vote for big\\nspending programs.\\nOn the surface, the contro\\nversy over the size of the\\nHouse Rules Committee seem\\ned a simple thing—the ma\\njority should rule, and no\\ncommittee should be able to\\nprevent legislation from get\\nting to the floor for a vote.\\nBut it wasn\\'t that simple.\\nActually, the so-called cru\\nsade for the right of the ma\\njority to rule in the House of\\nRepresentatives was just a\\nvehicle for pressure politics.\\nIn the corridors of the\\nHouse brazen politics has\\nbeen played. Members who\\ndidn\\'t wish to vote as the\\nKennedy administration\\nwanted \\'them to vote were\\ntold they might be punished\\nby losing the chance to get\\nappointments for their favor\\nite constituents. *\\nThere are plenty of ways,\\nof course, to get a bill acted\\non in the House of Repre\\nsentatives. The rules provide\\nthat, by signing a petition,\\nthe majority can discharge a\\ncommittee from considering\\na bill and thus get the meas\\nure before the House. But\\nsomehow it was decided by\\nthe radicals that a lesson\\nshould be taught Represent\\native Howard W. Smith of\\nVirginia, a conservative Dem\\nocrat He happens to be a\\nman who doesn’t believe in\\nspending the taxpayers’\\nmoney for unnecessary pur\\nposes and just to get votes.\\nHe and a number of other\\nDemocrats, have, in effect,\\nformed a coalition with Re\\npublicans to keep the radicals\\nDORIS FLEESON\\nHouse Victors Not Gloating\\nTough and Repeated Battles Expected\\nOn Bi ft, With Every Vote Counting\\nAs President Kennedy said\\nof his own election, the mar\\ngin is narrow, but the re\\nsponsibility is clear.\\nA coalition of 195 Demo\\ncrats and 22 progressive Re\\npublicans has crashed the\\nHouse Rules Committee road\\nblock against welfare legis\\nlation. The administration\\nis now obliged to offer the\\nlegislation and try to pass it\\non its merits.\\nNo one factor produced the\\nwinning margin of five votes\\nagainst 148 Republicans and\\n64 Democrats. House Speak\\ner Sam Rayburn\\'s hold on\\nthe loyalties of the flock he\\nhad led so long, the labors\\nof the President’s political\\naides in and out of the\\nWhite House, the President’s\\nown austere portrait of the\\nworld situation—had any one\\nof these failed to deliver, the\\nbattle would have been lost.\\nIt will take time to sort out\\nthe price paid and chart the\\nshifts of the past few days.\\nFor a few agonizing moments\\nbefore the vote began. House\\nliberals even heard fresh talk\\nof new compromises.\\nThey have won after years\\nRALPH McGILL\\nTwo Approving Views of Kennedy\\nBriton and Frenchman at the U. N. Cite\\nHopeful Factors in President\\'s Actions\\nThe Kennedys have hardly\\nhad time to learn where the\\nWhite House closets and\\nstorage rooms are, but al\\nready the critical eyes are at\\nwork.\\nThe British are usually the\\nmost articulate, with the\\nFrench close behind. And, at\\nany gathering of United Na\\ntions personnel both may be\\nheard. A couple of evalua\\ntions may be of interest. As\\nmight be anticipated the\\nFrench are the more materi\\nal, the British more philo\\nsophic. (This, I know, is con\\ntrary to the traditional view\\npoint, but it is my experi\\nence.)\\n“Kennedy,” said the French\\nrepresentative, “did more in a\\nmatter of hours than Eisen\\nhower did in years when he\\nended New York’s railroad\\ntugmen\\'s strike. This placed\\nhim in direct contrast with\\nMr. Eisenhower who had\\nmade a fetish of keeping\\nhands off the controversies.\\nThis was best illustrated by\\nthe steel dispute. Also,” said\\nthe Frenchman, “in this con\\nnection, I have since had a\\ndisrespect for the American\\nconservative opinion which\\nhad urged Mr. Eisenhower to\\nkeep out but which general\\nly applauded the Vice Presi\\ndent for moving in on the\\nsteel strike. Mr. Nixon be\\ncame the fulcrum on which\\nthe issue was turned. He\\ncould not have done it with\\nout White House approval.\\nHence, I was made very cyni\\ncal to read in these same\\nnews media that Mr. Kennedy\\nshould have remained aloof\\nin the New York strike as\\nMr. Eisenhower did in steel.\\nThis is neither true nor con\\nsistent. Mr. Eisenhower used\\nMr. N,..0n to kettle it.\\n“Here,” he said, \"we have\\na clear example of public\\ninterest. There must be some\\nfrom ruining the national\\neconomy by excessive spend\\ning. This coalition has oper\\nated successfully for many\\nyears to keep the so-called\\nliberals—who are really lib\\neral to a large extent only in\\nthe spending of, the taxpay\\ners’ money from plunging\\nthe Nation into bankruptcy.\\nIf this coalition is actually\\nbroken up, the Nation will\\nsuffer, and confidence in the\\nvalue of the dollar will drop\\nconsiderably everywhere.\\nThe Democratic political\\nleaders, in their desperation\\nto win the fight, adopted\\nbolder measures than ever\\nbefore. Perhaps the most\\nsignificant comment came in\\na remarkable editorial Tues\\nday in the New York Times,\\nwhich supported the Kennedy\\nticket in the last campaign.\\nUnder the caption “Lowest\\nDenominator ” the editorial\\nsaid:\\n“As the fight over the Rules\\nCommittee which reaches\\nits climax today amply\\nshows, President Kennedy\\nand his administration are\\nfully aware of the need to\\nmaintain as close and favor\\nable a connection as possible\\nbetween the White House and\\nthe Congress. But even the\\nmost desperate exigencies of\\nthe legislative situation do\\nnot excuse the political\\ndepths to which the new\\nadministration subjected it\\nself night before last In doing\\nobeisance to the prospective\\nchairman of the House Com\\nmittee on Education and\\nLabor, Representative Adam\\nClayton Powell of New York.\\n“Mr. Powell’s eight House\\nterms have been distinguished\\nfor nothing except their un\\nusually high rate of absentee\\nism. When he votes, he votes\\non the \\'liberal\\' side, but\\ndespite his extravagant ora\\ntory, Mr. Powell has no clear\\nrecord of legislative achieve\\nment; and it is recognized,\\nas one of his colleagues says,\\nthat ‘he hardly ever does any\\ncommittee work.’ Yet through\\nof frustration. But they are\\nnot gloating. One of their\\nprincipal spokesmen summed\\nit up as follows:\\n“The battle was bloody\\nevery step of the way. And it\\nis only the beginning. Every\\nbody should know now, in\\ncluding the President and his\\npeople in the Executive\\nbranch, that the prospect is\\nfor one grim fight after an\\nother. We can bring the\\nissues to the floor of the\\nHouse, but we win peed every\\nvote we can get”\\nNarrow legislative divisions\\nplace a premium on absentee\\nism by those members who\\nare subject to conflicting\\npressures. There were some\\nsuch when the rules vote was\\ntaken, though fewer than the\\nSpeaker had feared.\\nOne possibility exists which\\ncould soften the legislative\\nstruggle.\\nIf President Kennedy cap\\ntures the public Imagination,\\nif he manages to persuade\\nthe American people that\\ntheir tasks are as formidable\\nas he himself believes, the\\nreal steam will go out of the\\nconservative coalition. Its big-\\n20 million or more people in\\nthe New York metropolitan\\narea. The city also is the\\nNation’s central point of\\ndistribution and commerce.\\nSomething had to be done.\\nThe Government should have\\nacted. But it should have\\nproceeded intelligently. And\\nit did.\\n\"Here, if a foreigner may\\nsay so, is the essential dif\\nference between the Ken\\nnedy action in the New York\\nstrike and that of the Re\\npublicans in steel. The Gov\\nernment, in an indirect\\nsense, took charge in New\\nYork. The settlement was on\\nthe basis of h committee\\nwhose recommendations pre\\nsumably will end a complex\\nattrition growing out of the\\nIndustrial Revolution and\\nthe changes thereby wrought\\nin old Industries. Diesels\\nand a loss of rail business\\nare involved. In steel there\\nwas a truce. In this strike,\\nMr. Kennedy’s Secretary of\\nLabor could act on a com\\nmittee which provides a pos\\nsibility of long-time settle\\nment. In addition, it could\\nprovide a precedent for\\nagreements in disputes yet to\\noccur. Here is a gratifying\\npicture of Government in\\naction and, more important,\\na Government with a com\\nprehension of how to act.\\nThis is very important.”\\nHere is the Britisher\\'s\\ncomment:\\n\"I have reached this con\\nclusion about Kennedy,” he\\nsaid. “He possesses the enor\\nmous asset of not having to\\nthink every day about\\nwhether he is liked. This is\\na godsend. He was elected\\nwithout being very well liked.\\nMr. Nixon was even less well\\nliked. Neither was, or is, a\\npopular figure. The Ameri\\ncan people do not yet realize\\nhow fortunate they are in\\nthe inexorable law of senior\\nity, this Congressman who is\\nstill under indictment for\\nevasion of Federal income\\ntaxes is about to become\\nchairman of a major House\\ncommittee through which\\nsome of the administration’s\\nmost important domestic bills\\nwill pass.\\n“This is of course the prin\\ncipal reason—but it is an in\\nsufficient reason—why Presi\\ndent Kennedy addressed to\\nMr. Powell a telegram de\\nscribing how ‘Adam and I\\nhave worked together and\\ncampaigned together since\\nwe entered Congress in 1947.’\\nIt is, of course, the reason\\n—but a poor reason—why\\nSecretaries Ribicoff and\\nGoldberg, the two members\\nof President Kennedy’s cabi\\nnet whose departments are\\nmost likely to be affected by\\nMr. Powell’s committee, came\\nup from Washington in these\\nhectic early days just to\\nhonor the Powell-glorifica\\ntion dinner with their\\npresence, and to make their\\nhollow speeches.\\n“To make a hero out of\\nAdam Clayton Powell as did\\nthe President and his aides\\non Sunday night is to reduce\\npolitics to the lowest com\\nmon denominator, an action\\nentirely unworthy of the\\nhigh principles and the in\\nspiring projects of the Ken\\nnedy administration.”\\nEverybody knows what’s\\nback of all this. The Negro\\nvote is Important to the Ken\\nnedy administration in the\\nnext election—it helped im\\nmeasurably in carrying the\\nelectoral vote of the big\\nStates last November. The\\naverage Negro voter doesn’t\\nanalyze things as does the\\nNew York Times, but is in\\nclined to feel that anyone\\nwho is anti-Powel| is bad\\nand anyone who is pro-\\nPowell deserves support. This\\nis the thing that’s called\\npolitics as practiced by the\\nso-called liberals, whose\\nmotto in the House battle\\nseems to have been that “the\\nend justifies the means.”\\n(Copyright, 1861)\\nbusiness backing is not what\\nhas made the Smith-Halleck\\nalliapce formidable and ef\\nfective; it is the picture so\\nlong painted by former Presi\\ndent Eisenhower of a Nation\\nconfronting problems but do\\ning on the whole extremely\\nwell.\\nNo voice in Congress—and\\nsome were raised and no\\npolitical observer, whatever\\nhis prestige, could outtalk the\\nvictorious general who led the\\nWorld War n armies. They\\nprotested in vain and lit their\\ncandles in the darkness. Pres\\nident Eisenhower stood firm\\nand insisted all was well.\\nMany people believe he would\\nstill be doing so were it not\\nfor the Twenty-second\\nAmendment barring\\'him from\\na third term.\\nPresident Kennedy’s mod\\nerate manners after his close\\nelection had convinced some\\npeople that his course also\\nwould he much more moder\\nate than his campaign. His\\nstate-of - the - Union message\\nwent far to demolish the no\\ntion that somehow he wasn\\'t\\nas tough as he talks. The\\nRules vote amounts to a green\\nlight tor the White House,\\nand the Kennedy follow\\nthrough will be equally re\\nvealing.\\nthis respect. Nothing more\\neroded the American Repub\\nlic than its obsession with its\\nsentimental belief that no\\nmatter what Mr. Eisenhower\\ndid or did not do, it must\\nlift up its voice in a cheer\\nand proclaim that it liked Ike.\\nThis prevented any critical\\nexamination of its own pub\\nlic mind and of events. Now,\\nit does not \\'like* Kennedy in\\nthat sense. It is watching\\nhim with very real interest\\nand examination. It is pre\\npared not to like him. It is\\nnot emotionally committed to\\na slogan.\\n\"All that is to the good,\\nbut,” continued the British\\ndiplomat, “what is more im\\nportant is that already, in\\nthese brief days, we see a\\nfellow at work for the coun\\ntry. He does not have to\\nwork for himself or his own\\nlegend. He is not in the\\nHoratio Alger tradition.\\nTherefore, he does not need\\nto deal in .homespun expres\\nsions or epigrams out of the\\ncopy books. He can act. Here\\nis a man who may be a great\\none. And this, I think, the\\npeople will learn in time.”\\nThese are the things one\\nhears if one keeps an open\\near at the United Nations.\\nIf one does not agree, one\\nnonetheless is stimulated.\\nManagement Group\\nTo Hold Round Table\\nThe Washington Chapter for\\nthe Society for the Advance\\nment of Management is spon\\nsoring a “Frontiers of Man\\nagement Roundtable” tonight\\nat 7:30 o’clock at the Main\\nPost Office auditorium,\\nTwelfth street and Constitu\\ntion avenue N.W.\\nThe program will Include a\\ndiscussion of the application\\nof polio and influenza vaccina\\ntion control.\\nSENATOR CAUCUS -By Wy«”\\n.corp: Ml cch-l praturw cowß. tm.worlo wiaHTe mvo.\\n“Now that the Congresswoman has left the\\nroom, I’ll tell you what I really think of your\\n* X !

Most of these are in the\\nfamily and marital counseling\\nfields. Hans Klagsbrunn, act\\ning chairman of the HWC\\nboard, said that many of these\\nindividuals are untrained and\\nincompetent.\\nReading from a written\\nopinion, William B. Jones, gen\\neral counsel of the HWC. said\\n“obviously this report has for\\nits commendatory purpose the\\nraising of standards in the\\nfield of private family counsel\\ning and the making available\\nto those in the need of such\\ncounseling family counselors\\npossessing at least the mini\\nmum standards of professional\\ncompetency.”\\nCrossed Off\\nThe attorney went on to say\\nthat should some persons en\\ngaged in social work be deemed\\nunsuitable by the HWC, they\\nwould not appear on the ap\\nproved list. Also, Mr. Jones\\nsaid, those who, after being\\nplaced on the list, failed to\\ncontinue to comply with the\\nstandards would have their\\nnames removed from the list.\\nAlthough the standards of\\nthe HWC would have no legal\\nbearing on private social work\\ners, Mr. Jones said, “such per\\nsons as HWC fconsidered un\\nworthy of listing or of being\\nretained on the list would be\\nexpected to suffer a loss in\\ntheir clientele and thus be ad-\\nversely affected In the income\\nproducing activities of their\\ncalling.”\\nMr. Jones also pointed out\\nthat the District of Columbia,\\nMaryland and Virginia, the\\nthree jurisdictions in which\\nHWC operates, no legislation\\nnow exists to outline minimum\\nstandards for social work in\\nprivate practices.\\nThe board of directors then\\nvoted to go ahead with the\\nstudy after the language in\\ntwo paragraphs of the proposal\\nhad been amended. The first\\namendment dealt with the pur\\npose of the proposal. The lan\\nguage “of establishing mini\\nmum standards” was changed\\nto “study appropriate stand\\nards.”\\nThe second amendment stip\\nulated that the results of the\\nstudy not be released (to the\\npress), but would be reported\\nto the HWC board of directors\\nonly.\\nROADS\\nContinued From Page D-20\\n—South Capitol street remains\\nclosed between L and M streets\\nfor construction of an under\\npass to carry South Capitol be\\nlow M street: traffic detoured:\\nabout 10 months to complete.\\nL street N.W.

The children waved\\nwildly back and the grown-ups smiled.\\n“There you see one reason why I’m\\nbeginning to feel optimistic about this\\noperation,” the captain told his pas\\nsengers. “At first the people around\\nhere wouldn’t even look at us. Some\\ntimes we’d drive through a village,\\nand we wouldn’t see a single person.\\nThey’d be hiding in their houses.\\n“Now they accept us. A lot of them\\nare even friendly.\\n“But better than that, they seem\\nto be convinced that we can help give\\nthem security. Moje than 2,000 in\\nthis province have voluntarily left\\nthe Red zone and moved into the\\nareas the government cleared of\\nCommunists.”\\nThe captain shifted around so he\\ncould see his passengers and summed\\nup his feelings about the war for\\nSouth Viet Nam:\\n“A month ago I thought our whole\\nprogram here was failing. But now\\nI think it can work.”\\nSpreading Optimism\\nThis “cautious optimism” has\\nspread lately among the American\\nofficials who started the “extra push\"\\nlast winter to keep this wavering\\ncountry from falling behind the Iron\\nCurtain.\\nIt has been reflected in views ex\\npressed by men such as Secretary of\\nDefense McNamara, returning from\\nthe latest Honolulu conference on\\nViet Nam, and Admiral George W.\\nAnderson, chief of naval operations,\\njust back from an Asian inspection\\ntour.\\nThese views are based on progress\\nreports—by men like this captain—\\non the first phase of the new counter\\noffensive in Viet Nam.\\nThe Americans working in the hin\\nterlands of Viet Nam say the Com\\nmunists are being pushed back.\\nThe conclusion of top military and\\ncivilian officials on the scene is that\\nthe war of covert aggression in Viet\\nNam can be won by the anti-Com\\nmunists.\\nIt should be emphasized that they\\nsay “can.\" No one says victory is\\nsure.\\nNo one knows what the Commu\\nnists will do next. No one can guar\\nantee that the Viet Namese govern\\nment will remain stable and will do\\nenough of the right things to carry\\nthe job through for the many years\\nit probably will take.\\nBut at least the job no longer looks\\nimpossible to the men who are do\\ning it.\\nSigns of Progress\\nWhat are the signs of progress?\\nFirst, there is the bloody yardstick\\nof sudden death. Once the Viet Cong\\n(as the Communist guerrilas call\\nthemselves) had their own way in\\nkillings. Now, however, the govern\\nment forces are killing more Viet\\nCong soldiers than they are losing.\\nAlso, large areas have been made\\n\"secure” from Communist raiding.\\nWhen Gen. Paul D. Harkins, boss\\nof all American soldiers in Viet Nam\\nand Thailand, was in Phu Yen Prov\\nince recently for a briefing, the head\\nAmerican adviser in the area, a\\neager, young major, showed him a\\nmap that pictures the push-back in\\nthat one difficult province.\\nBefore the new program was\\nlaunched, Phu Yen was almost com\\npletely in the “red zone” under ef\\nfective control of the Communists\\nwith extensive mountain areas in the\\n“black zone” (so infested that gov\\nernment troops didn’t even bother\\ngoing there) plus some \"blue-zone”\\nIff\\nWeary Viet Namese troops sprawl in a Navy troop carrier.\\n—AP Wirephoto vl* radio from Saigon\\nWje lEmumi Slat\\nV J V .X WITH SUNDAY MORNING EDITION\\nSPECIAL REPORT\\nPentagon Reporter Richord Fryklsud, this year\\'s\\nwinner of the Raymond Clapper award, has\\njast returned from a far-ranging inspection\\nof the South Viet Norn front.\\nareas where the government was at\\nleast battling it out on even terms.\\nNow There\\'s Yellow\\nBut the map shown Gen. Harkins\\nafter the first 90-day phase of the\\npush - back in that province intro\\nduced a new color—a “yellow zone”\\nthat was for all practical purposes\\nfree of Communists.\\nThe yellow zone covered only about\\n15 per cent of the map, but it in\\ncluded most of the key towns along\\nthe coast and on the principal rivers.\\n“By the end of the year most of\\nthe important populated areas of\\nthe province should be in the yellow\\nzone,” the major told Gen. Harkins.\\n\"The government should be able to\\nmaintain control over one-third of\\nthe province without having to use\\nregular troops. This will free the\\nregulars to concentrate on the blue\\nand red zones.”\\nThe yellow zones are expanding\\nthroughout the country.\\nAs they expand, more and more\\nof the Viet Namese people living in\\nthose zones have an inducement to\\nshift their loyalty from the Viet Cong\\nto the government. American mili\\ntary advisers with the government\\nforces say they are shifting their\\nallegiance.\\n“It’s not just the fact that the peo\\nple are starting to be friendly with\\nus,” one of these advisers said.\\n“They’re starting to help us, too.\\n“The key to the military operation\\nhere is intelligence. The villagers\\nknow everything that the Viet Cong\\nis doing in this province. If they\\ntell us, then we can stop the Com\\nmunists from operating.”\\nIntelligence gathering remains a\\nmajor problem, but some useful in\\ntelligence is coming in. Government\\ntroops in Phu Yen and elsewhere in\\nViet Nam are carrying out major of\\nfensive operations almost daily that\\ndepend on information gathered from\\npeople whom the Communists thought\\nwould keep their location a secret.\\nFriendly Environment\\nExperts on guerrilla warfare like to\\nquote the Chinese Communist mas\\nter of the art, Mao Tse-tung, who\\nonce said that guerrillas are like the\\nfish and the people like the water.\\nThe people must provide a friendly\\nenvironment or the fish cannot live.\\nIn Viet Nam one side need not de\\nfeat the other in pitched battles in\\norder to win. Victory can go to the\\nside that wins over the mass of the\\npeople.\\nAnother encouraging sign is that\\nthe government troops are using\\nAmerican help more willingly and\\nmore skillfully.\\nAn American Marine Corps colonel\\nin the rich delta country in the south\\nof Viet Nam reported to Admiral An\\nderson that when he first came, he\\nwas supposed to help two Viet Nam\\ndivisions by ferrying troops in heli\\ncopters in raids against the Commu\\nnists. The local commanders seemed\\ndubious about the value of the chop\\npers, however, and didn’t use them\\nmuch.\\nNow reported the colonel, they are\\ncalling on him regularly, and a third\\ndivision nearby is getting as much\\nhelicopter aid as it can squeeze out.\\nThese signs of progress explain the\\nnew optimism over Viet Nam. But\\nwith the word \"optimism” top officials\\nalways put the word \"cautious.” No\\none expects the Communists to take\\nContinued on Page A-8\\nWASHINGTON, D.

Don\\novan. refused to confirm or\\ndeny rumors that freeing of\\nthe prisoners is imminent. He\\npreviously had acknowledged\\nthat he has been in touch with\\nFidel Castro’s government and.\\nif necessary, will go to Havana\\nto enter into direct negotia\\ntions.\\nThe situation has become\\nsteadily worse for the prisoners\\nstill held since the abortive in\\nvasion last year. One recently\\nreleased man looked as if he\\nhad come out of a wartime\\nconcentration camp.\\nHumanitarian Appeals\\nMr. Donovan’s approach to\\nthe Cuban government has\\nbeen based on humanitarian\\nappeals. He has made the point\\nthat he wants to see what can\\nbe done by the American peo\\nple to help the Cuban people.\\nThat’s why the approach has\\nbeen an offer of food, med\\nicine and other essentials des\\nperately needed by all the\\nCuban people. Earlier ap\\nproaches dealt first with trac\\ntors and then with cash to\\nransom the prisoners.\\nMr. Donovan is general coun\\nsel for the Cuban Families\\nCommittee for Liberation of\\nPrisoners of War.

Oreg., the 30,000 window clerks\\nin more than 10,000 first and second class post offices\\nwill be issued natty blue uniforms.\\nMale clerks will have a jacket of Peking blue <the\\nsame now worn by postal truck drivers) with white or\\nblue shirts and maroon neckties, either bows or four-in\\nhands.\\nWoman clerks will have a similar fitted jacket with\\na blue or white blouse.\\nThe exact cost of the window dressing program was\\nnot announced, but a spokesman for the department\\nhere said $16.4 million was spent last year on 175.000\\nuniformed employes. By this yardstick, the additional\\nuniforms would cost something under $3 million.\\nA BIG DAY AT THE BEACH\\nSenate Unit Approves\\nStronger Drug Control\\nJudiciary Group Passes Kennedy Bill;\\nIndustry Backs Curbs at House Hearing\\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee today approved unani\\nmously a bill recommended by President Kennedy to plaee\\ntighter controls on the manufacture and sale of drugs.\\nSenator Kefauver, Democrat of Tennessee, who began\\ninvestigating the drug industry a yetr ago, said this bill\\n“should go a long way toward assuring the American people\\nthat drugs are not only safe,\\nbut will do what is claimed for\\nthem.”\\nThe Senators acted as the\\nHouse Commerce Committee\\ncontinued hearings on the same\\nsubject.\\nThe Senators acted as the |\\nHouse Commerce Committee\\nheard a spokesman for the\\nPharmaceutical Manufacturers\\nAssociation ask for stronger\\nGovernment regulation of the\\nindustry. At the same time, the\\nwitness warned that the new\\nrules should be carefully drawn\\nso they do not cut off the flow\\nof beneficial new drugs.\\nTwo Goals Cited\\nSenator Kefauver said the\\nbill passed by the Senate group\\nwill accomplish two of the three \\'\\ngoals he had in mind when he\\nintroduced the original bill in\\nApril, 1961, namely, safer drugs\\nand better information to doc\\ntors.\\nHis third objective was lower\\nprices.\\nThe Senator said some pro\\nvisions of this bill will operate\\nto reduce the prices of non\\npatented medicine, such as the\\nauthority of the Government to\\nestablish simple generic names\\nfor such drugs.\\nBut he pointed out that 60\\ni per cent of the medicines in use\\nare patented and the new bill\\nI as it came from committee will\\nnot bring down those prices.\\nAmendments Planned\\nSenator Kefauver plans, how\\njever, to offer two amendments\\nin the Senate to control prices\\nof patented drugs.\\nOne amendment would re-\\nI quire a company to file with its\\npatent any agreements relating\\nto assignment of markets or\\neffecting prices.\\nThe second amendment would\\nprovide that, if after a patent\\nhas been in effect for three\\nyears the Government finds the\\nprice to druggists is 500 per,\\ncent or more of the factory\\ncost including research, it could\\nrequire the patent-holder to |\\nlicense its use to other qualified\\napplicants upon payment of a |\\nrayalty of up to 8 per cent.\\nThe provisions of the bill as\\nreported would:\\nRequire the Food and Drug\\ni Administration to pass on both\\nsafety and claims for efficacy\\nof drugs.\\nRequire that advertising show\\nthe generic name of the medi-\\nSee DRUGS, Page A-6\\nI I\\n! i\\nPress Conference Set !\\nPresident Kennedy will hold\\na press conference at 4 p.m.\\n■ Wednesday, the White House\\ni announced today.

Hence, demon\\nstrators were within their\\nrights in pursuing their ob\\njectives and the restaurant\\nowner was being \"coerced”\\nby city officials and was not\\nacting of his own accord in\\nmaintaining segregated lunch\\ncounters.\\nThese confusing interpre\\ntations were by no means\\nunanimous.

Chief Justice War\\nren said, with regard to dne\\nof the cases, that incitement\\nto disorder may occur, but\\nthat those whose acts gave\\nrise to the riots or disorders\\ncould not be punished. He\\nsaid:\\n\"But it is sufficient to say\\nagain that a generally\\nworded statute, when con\\nstrued to punish conduct\\nwhich cannot be constitu\\ntionally punished, is uncon\\nstitutionally vague.\\n\"And the possibility of dis\\norder by others cannot justi\\nfy exclusion of persons from\\na place if they otherwise have\\na constitutional right\\nfounded upon the equal pro\\ntection clause—to be pres\\nent.”\\nThe mere fact that the\\npolice felt that demonstra\\ntions and riots might ensue\\nwas not sufficient ground for\\nthe police to arrest those who\\nrefused to obey their orders.\\nIncidentally, the court’s\\ncomment that the law can\\nnot intervene until an ac\\ntual disorder takes place is\\ninteresting in view of the re\\ncent action of the President\\nof the United States in or\\ndering troops to Alabama on\\nthe theory that there might\\nbe disorders.

       "  'raw_text': 'DAVID LAWRENCE\\nAttorney General and Rights Bill\\nRecognition That Measure Imperils\\nProgram by Going Too Far Is Seen\\nAttorney General Kennedy\\nhas just made a remarkable\\nstatement to the House Judi\\nciary Committee on the\\nwhole subject of “civil\\nrights\" legislation. In a nut\\nshell, he recognizes that the\\nmeasure reported out by the\\nsubcommittee, while desira\\nble in Its objectives, goes too\\nfar and might even Imperil\\nultimate enactment of the\\nentire program.\\nIn the course of his testi\\nmony. the Attorney General\\nsuggested some ways to di\\nminish opposition to the bill.\\nHe said, for instance, that it\\nwould be unwise for the Fed\\neral government to Interfere\\nIn State, county and city\\nelections and that it should\\nconfine itself to Federal elec\\ntions. But Mr. Kennedy’s\\nmain objection was to the\\nwide sweep of authority\\nWhich the pending bill would\\ngive to the Federal govem\\nment to regulate customer\\nrelations in “public accom\\nmodations.” He said the\\nprinciple behind the bill\\n—namely, that all forms of\\nracial discrimination are\\nequally objectionable—ls a\\nmoral one, but that he be\\nlieves the original anti\\ndiscrimination p r op o s a 1,\\nwhich did not attempt to ex\\ntend Federal law to cover ev\\nery form of “public accom\\nmodations,” was a much bet\\nter approach. Mr. Kennedy\\nfeels that many of the prob\\nlems can be solved by volun\\ntary means. He declared:\\n“We were reluctant to ex\\ntend Federal power beyond\\nthose areas where It was\\nclearly needed to meet exist\\ning problems. The subcom\\nmittee has added to this cov\\nerage a catch-all which pro\\nhibits discrimination In any\\nbusiness operating under\\nState or local ‘authorization,\\npermission, or license.’ This\\naddition meets none of the\\ncriteria we thought Impor\\ntant.\\n“What businesses are cov-\\nMAX FREEDMAN\\nCommon Sense on Wheat Deal\\nExcess Political Passion and False Tears\\nFound in U.S. Over Sale to Russia\\nExcept In the United\\nStates, it Is possible to dis\\ncuss trade with Russia in a\\nsensible way without creating\\na political quarrel. Only here\\ndoes a simple commercial\\ntransaction get entangled\\nwith the fierce suspicions of\\nthe cold war. This reaction\\nseems hardly worthy of com\\nmon sense of the American\\npeople.\\nThe sale of wheat and\\nflour to Russia does not open\\nup a vast new market to the\\nAmerican farmer. Nor do the\\npresent shortages in Russia\\nmark the failure of Soviet\\nagriculture. Mr. Maudllng,\\nthe British chancellor of the\\nexchequer, has been much\\nmore candid on this point\\nthan has the Kennedy ad\\nministration. He has ob\\nserved that drought and\\nshortages are not uncommon\\neven in capitalist countries.\\nThe Voice of America may\\ntry to tell the Russian people\\nthat the United States Is\\nselling wheat to the Soviet\\nRussians at Russia\\'s request.\\nBut for every Russian who\\nhears these broadcasts, there\\nare thousands of Russian cit\\nizens who have already heard\\nand read the Soviet an\\nnouncement that the United\\nStates is making this sale In\\norder to reduce surplus Amer\\nican supplies and storage\\ncosts. The Voice of America\\nwill be making a serious\\nblunder If It tries to convert\\nthe wheat deal Into a propa\\nganda war. It would be wise\\nto stay away from this silly\\nexercise altogether. The\\nwheat transaction must\\nstand or fall on its own mer\\nits.\\nMoreover, the Kennedy\\nadministration cannot block\\nthe sale of Russian wheat to\\nCuba by anything said or\\ndone in Washington. All that\\ncan be done by this country\\nis to lay down conditions\\nt,hat American wheat will not\\nbe shipped to Cuba. It is not\\nnecessary for Russia to break\\nthese conditions by dell\\nberate bad faith. A much\\nsimpler course is open to her.\\nIf Russia wants to help\\nCuba, she can dip into her\\nown supply of grain or send\\nwheat to Cuba bought from\\nother countries.\\nCanada recognizes this fact\\nas one which she could\\nneither change nor control.\\nAs a result there was no at\\ntempt in the Canadian sale\\nto bar all shipments to Cuba.\\nBut a Canadian politician\\ncan talk rationally about\\nCuba without being burled\\namong a mountain of abuse.\\nNo such freedom exists for\\nan American politician.\\nVarious members of Con\\ngress have tried to attach\\npolitical conditions to the\\nAmerican sale. They have\\nsaid, for example, that no\\nwheat should go to Russia\\nuntil Soviet troops leave\\nCuba. This is not quite as\\nbrazen a demand as Chancel\\nlor Adenauer\\'s condition that\\nno American wheat be sold\\nunless the Berlin wall is re\\nmoved. Dr. Adenauer im\\nposed no such conditions on\\nhis own German government.\\nWest Germany has already\\nered by this provision are\\nunclear. It would seem to ex\\ntend Federal regulation to\\nlaw firms, medical partner\\nships and clinics, private\\nschools, apartment houses,\\ninsurance companies, banks,\\nand. potentially, to all busi\\nnesses which a State does\\nnot affirmatively ban. And\\nIts application, If a narrower\\nInterpretation is proper, is In\\nany event uneven to the ex\\ntent that It depends upon\\nwidely divergent State licens\\ning practices to determine\\nits coverage.”\\nMr. Kennedy pointed out\\nthat, while excesses by the\\npolice have occurred, the\\nproposed use of broad in\\njunctive power might create\\nnew problems for the Federal\\ngovernment. He said that be\\nfore the proposed section of\\nthe pending bill could be\\nused, it would have to be\\nclear “that a Federally pro\\ntected right has been or is\\nabout to be violate d.\" He\\ncontlnueu.\\n“It would be a mistake to\\nassume that all demonstra\\ntions are protected because\\ntheir alms are consistent\\nwith national policy and are\\nsupported by the vast major\\nity of the American people—\\nlike peaceful protests against\\nracial discrimination. Limita\\ntions may be constitutionally\\nimposed upon the time of\\ndemonstrations, their dura\\ntion, their place and the\\nnumber of people. Not all\\ndemonstrations are protected\\nby the First and Fourteenth\\nAmendments. Thus, no mat\\ni ter how bitterly they may be\\nresented, not all offensive\\npolice conduct In connection\\nwith civil rights demonstra\\ntions would be within the\\nreach of Title HI.”\\nThe Attorney General\\nspoke of the basic danger of\\ni relying on injunctions to\\n; control In advance the ac\\ntions of local police. He said:\\n“One result might be that\\nState and local authorities\\nsold large supplies of wheat\\nand flour to the Communist\\ncountries and the Berlin wall\\nis still standing. Unlike Dr.\\nAdenauer, the critical Ameri\\ncan Senators and Represen\\ntatives are not being hypo\\ncritical In suggesting their\\nown political conditions.\\nThey are merely being futile.\\nFor their demands would\\nleave the situation In Cuba\\nabsolutely unchanged while\\nAmerican wheat would con\\ntinue to pile up In our stor\\nage blns.

As\\nmatters are now going, how\\never. Gen. Eisenhower may\\nplay a part In re-electing Mr.\\nKennedy, however much the\\nGeneral would wish to do\\notherwise.\\nFor the former President Is\\ncreating the Impression that\\nhe is not now, and probably\\nwill not be, heart and soul\\nfor the most likely Republi\\ncan presidential nominee In\\n1964. Os course, It is too ear\\nly to say that Senator Gold\\nwater will be nominated, but\\npolitical leaders seem to\\nagree that the present odds\\nfavor It.\\nUnfortunately for Senator\\nGoldwater, the whole trend\\nof Gen. Eisenhower’s public\\ndiscussions in his effort to\\nhelp the Republican cause\\nserves chiefly to raise ques\\ntions about the Senator\\'s\\nqualifications.\\nThis Is a familiar condition\\nfor those who have followed\\nGen. Eisenhower’s political\\ncareer. A shadow of doubt\\nalways fell upon his confi\\ndence In his once most likely\\nsuccessor, Richard M. Nixon.\\nWhenever the former Presi\\ndent was questioned about\\nMr. Nixon, what he said and\\nthe way he said It was usual\\nly subject to some shade of\\nadverse construction. The\\nwords would not come out of\\nthe General in a wholly con\\nvincing way.\\nIn retrospect. It can be\\nseen that Gen. Eisenhower\\nwanted to get rid of Mr. Nix\\non as the vice-presidential\\nnominee In 1956; it Is hard\\nto Interpret events In any\\nother way, whatever the\\nGeneral may have said about\\nIt, then or since. Not even In\\n1960, when it was clear that\\nMr. Nixon would be the\\nRepublican presidential\\nnominee, could Gen.

The net effect was a Nix\\non detachment from the\\nmost popular Republican\\nPresident in history.\\nWith his usual political\\nsensitivity, John F. Kennedy\\nunderstood this condition\\nand understands it now. Mr.\\nKennedy comprehends that\\nhowever much Gen. Elsen\\nhower may profess his Repub\\nlicanism. In the strict party\\nsense, the real role of the\\nGeneral Is bipartisan He\\ncould have been nominated\\nin 1952 as either a Republi\\ncan or a Democrat, and he\\nwas supported, and still is\\nsupported, by both Republi\\ncans and Democrats.\\nTherefore, whenever the\\nformer President speaks 111 of\\nhim, Mr. Kennedy turns the\\nother cheek. Furthermore,\\nwhenever he can do so in\\ngood conscience, Mr. Kenne\\ndy identifies his interests\\nwith the General’s.\\nNothing would serve Mr.\\nKennedy\\'s political Interests\\nbetter than to have a linger\\ning doubt hang over the elec\\ntion of 1964 on Gen. Eisen\\nhower’s confidence In the\\nRepublican presidential\\nnominee.\\nAnd. it Is just the shadow\\nof this doubt which Gen. El\\nsenhower is beginning to\\ncreate by his attitude on the\\n1964 nominee. For example,\\nwhy would he wish to discuss\\nIn public, even hypothetical\\nly, the far-out constitutional\\nquestion of whether he, as a\\nformer two-term President\\nmight run for Vice President\\nwithin the meaning of the\\nTwenty-second Amendment?\\nSuch discussion inevitably\\ncreates the impression that\\nthe Republican presidential\\nnominee would be too weak\\nto win on his own. or unwor\\nthy of full confidence\\nWhat effect does Gen El\\nsenhower s desire for fuller\\nexposition of Senator Gold\\nwater’s views have except to\\ncreate the impression that he\\nis not satisfied? And later on\\nif he declares himself to be\\nsatisfied, how convincing will\\nthis be and what ways will\\nMr. Kennedy find to remind\\nvoters of Gen.

There are\\nample case histories, however, of\\nthose as Grant, Monroe and\\nTheodore Roosevelt—who found it\\ndifficult to adjust to the peculiar\\nlimbo into which America cast\\nits ex-Presidents after it stripped\\nthem of perquisites and portfolio.\\nHarry Truman’s current pique\\nover his party’s choice of Senator\\nKennedy as its candidate for the\\noffice he once held and his im\\npotence to do anything about it—\\nor about the nomination of Adlai\\nStevenson over his objections in\\n1956—might provide another case\\nin point, though Mr. Truman ap\\npears to have settled happily into\\nthe role of private citizen in other\\nregards.\\nAll of which is preface to a sta\\ntistical note of some significance.\\nWhen President Eisenhower joins\\nMr. Truman and Herbert Hoover\\nin retirement in January, the\\nUnited States will have three liv\\ning ex-Presidents for the first\\ntime since the death of Gen.\\nGrant in 1885.\\nMr. Eisenhower’s situation is\\nunique in national history in that\\nhe will be the first President\\never barred—by the two-term\\nlimitation of the Twenty-Second\\nAmendment—from returning to\\noffice.\\nProposals Lag\\nThere are some who feel that\\nall former Presidents should be\\nmade members of the Senate, but\\nthe proposal has gained little\\nheadway in recent years.

P. news dispatches.\\nA-22\\nJimmy Hoffa Rides Again\\nWhatever his basic objective may\\nbe, President James R. Hoffa of the\\nTeamsters Union is operating from a\\nposition of strength at the union’s\\nMiami Beach convention.\\nMr, Hoffa’s strength rests on the\\nfollowing* (1) While the AFL-CIO,\\nwhich expelled his outfit four years ago,\\nihas been losing membership in the\\nmeantime, the teamsters have picked up\\nan estimated 300,000 to bring their rolls\\nto approximately 1.7 million members;\\n<2) he has survived not only a rough\\ngping-over at the hands of the Senate\\nRackets Committee but several legal\\nbattles designed to remove him from\\noffice, and (3) he has no serious oppo\\nsition to re-election this week as presl\\ndent of his union. Closely related to\\nthe latter factor, and comparably\\nfavored, are his plans for increasing\\npier capita dues in order to hire more\\nprofessional organizers, to step up mem\\nbership drives in new fields, to raise the\\nUnion’s strike benefits, to increase union\\npensions—and perhaps to raise Mr.\\nHoffa’s own salary.\\n< As far as his long-range planning\\n1$ concerned, Mr. Hoffa appears to be\\nstrategically poised either to fight the\\nAFL-CIO (perhaps forming a new fed\\neration under teamster domination), or\\nto rejoin the older group (pretty much\\nbn his own terms). With reference to\\nthe first alternative, Mr. Hoffa was\\nreported as telling a press conference\\nthat he has had conversations with\\nthree other established unions about\\npossible affiliation with the teamsters.\\nAlthough he did not identify these\\ngroups, there was speculation that he\\nmight move into the construction, laun\\ndry and bakery fields. At the same time,\\nwhile emphasizing that the teamsters\\n“are not knocking on the door” of the\\nAFL-CIO, Mr. Hoffa added that his\\nunion “would not turn down an offer to\\nreturn,” provided their organizing free\\ndom were not restricted.\\nMr. Hoffa is not best known, of\\ncourse, for his modesty, and it is only\\nreasonable to assume that there is a\\ncertain amount of bluster in his talk.\\nIn challenging the big federation, if\\nthat is really what he is doing, he is\\nnot tilting with a straw man or with\\nopposition labor leaders who are timid\\nor unskilled. It is true, however, that\\nfactional troubles never have been far\\nbelow the surface of the AFL-CIO and\\nthat some of them have become in\\ncreasingly obvious in recent months.\\nCurrently, Mr. Hoffa has the advantage\\nof riding high—of a command position\\nthat is undivided versus one that oper\\nates by committee. How these two\\nforces work out their power struggle is\\nfirst of all of immediate concern to\\norganized labor. But it is also of great\\nconcern to the Nation.\\nNational Zoo\\nThe decision that the Smithsonian\\nInstitution after this year will bear the\\nexpense of capital Improvements at the\\nZoo will remove a burdensome and illog\\nical load from the District government.\\nBy no stretch of the imagination is the\\nZoo a municipal enterprise. It is in\\nreality as much a national institution as\\nthe Smithsonian itself, a fact that is\\ndemonstrated by the administrative\\ncontrol which the Smithsonian has exer\\ncised over the Zoo from its origin. Yet\\nfor all these years, due to the arbitrary\\ndecision of an earlier Congress, the tax\\npayers of Washington have been saddled\\nwith its entire expense.\\nThe assumption of capital improve\\nments as a Federal responsibility recti\\nfies only a part of the wrong, however.\\nWe hope that the same reasoning which\\nled to this change also will be extended\\nnext year to cover the routine costs of\\noperating and maintaining the Zoo. If\\nit makes no sense for the District gov\\nernment to have to buy a new lion’s\\ncage, it obviously makes no sense for\\nthe District to have to pay for the feed\\ning and care of the lion.\\nAll the same, the Smithsonian\\nBoard of Regents is to be commended\\nfor taking this Important first step, one\\nwhich certainly will be in the best inter\\nests of the Zoo itself. The shameful\\ndeficiencies and outmoded facilities of\\nthis wonderful park have been fold too\\nmany times to need repetition here. It\\nis the intention of the regents that,\\nstarting next year, sufficient Federal\\nappropriations will be sought annually\\nto make the desirable improvements on\\nan orderly basis over a period of time.\\nAs an initial stride in this direction, it\\nis especially important that the Zoo\\nWEDNESDAY, JULY 5,196 T\\ndirector, Dr. Theodore Reed, be giveh\\nthe $50,000 he is seeking to prepare a\\nmaster plan for rehabilitating the park.\\nTroika and the U. N.\\nWhen the General Assembly meets\\n(Deo volente) for its 16th regular session\\nnext fall, one of the big issues before\\nit will have to do with proposals for\\ndrastic political and operating changes\\nin the present administrative structure\\nofcthe United Nations. To put it mildly,\\nthe issue threatens to generate a hot de\\nbate, and it conceivably could do irrep\\narable harm to the world organization.\\nThis danger, of course, stems pri\\nmarily from Premier Khrushchev’s ap\\nparent determination—repeatedly ex\\npressed by himself and his propagandists\\nthroughout the past year—to get rid of\\nSecretary General Dag Hammarskjold\\nand replace the Secretary’s office with\\na triumvirate made up of a “neutralist,”\\na Westerner and a Communist. Clearly,\\nsince each of these three would have\\nthe power to veto anything and every\\nthing of substance, such an arrangement\\nwould be an executive monstrosity\\ncapable of reducing the U. N.—Assembly\\nand Security Council alike—to complete\\n. paralysis and uselessness in times of\\ninternational crisis.\\nNevertheless, Mr. Khrushchev has\\nplainly indicated that he intends to keep\\non demanding that Mr. Hammarskjold\\nand the U. N. Secretariat be swept away\\nto make room for this hydra-headed\\nparalyzer A-an organizational set-up so\\ninherently and so obviously unworkable\\nthat the Kremlin’s growing insistence\\nupon it suggests that the Soviet Union,\\nfor reasons best known to itself, is\\nseeking to destroy the United Nations\\nby reducing it to an absurdity. Nor have\\nthe so-called “uncommitted” or “un\\naligned” nations of Asia and Africa\\nbeen of much help in this matter. On\\nthe contrary, their “compromise” pro\\nposal—which would retain the office\\nof Secretary General but still subject\\nit to the veto of three deputies, “neu\\ntralist,” Western or Communist—seems\\nquite as bad as Mr. Khrushchev’s, only\\nperhaps a bit less forthright, and much\\nmore naive.\\nIn these circumstances, It is good\\nthat Mr. Hammarskjold, in a formal\\ncommentary on a special study of the\\nsubject, has once again emphasized that\\nhe is unalterably opposed to the Soviet\\neffort to transform the U. N. into an\\nInternational political troika, with each\\nof the three horses at liberty to gallop\\noff, at whim, in any and all directions.\\nTo be sure, he favors reorganizing\\nthe secretariat in away that will enable\\nqualified Communists and “neutralists”\\nto move into more administrative jobs\\nthan they have now, but he has left no\\nroom for doubt that he will defend his\\noffice against all Red efforts to destroy\\nits Independence, impartiality and\\nobjectivity.\\nIn all of this, it need hardly be\\nz added, the Secretary General can count\\nupon the strong support of the United\\nStates and the West in general. And he\\ncan rely, too, on those nations of Asia\\nand Africa that have kept their eyes\\nopen and see clearly, despite the Krem\\nlin’s efforts to fog up everything, how\\nthe troika principle, if adopted, could\\nbury the U. N. and their own hopes\\nwith it.\\nChange in Korea\\nIn resigning both as Premier and as\\nhead of the military junta that seized\\n• power in South Korea little more than a\\nmonth ago, 36-year-old Lieutenant Gen\\neral Chang Do-young appears to have\\ncaved in under pressures demanding\\nstronger leadership. At any rate, al\\nthough the situation remains rather\\nobscure, that is the way his sudden\\ndeparture from political eminence is\\n» being generally interpreted in Seoul.\\nThe new Premier is Defense Min\\nister Song Yo-chan, 43, who served with\\ndistinction as army chief of staff during\\nthe regime of ousted President Syngman\\nRhee, and who is a retired lieutenant\\ngeneral. Apparently, again according\\nto reports from Seoul, he is widely re\\nspected among his countrymen for his\\ntoughness, his integrity and his deter\\nmination to stand fast against commu\\nnism and promote far-reaching polit\\nical and economic reforms in South\\nKorea.\\nImportant as his post may be, how\\never, Premier Song is subordinate to\\nthe man who has replaced General\\nChang as chairman of the junta. This\\nman is Major General Pak Chung-hi,\\naged 44. Actually, he is said to have\\nbeen the chief organizer of the May\\ncoup and the real power behind the\\nscenes ever since, with Chang’s regime\\nserving merely as a kind of front for\\nhim. In any case, he now has assumed\\nthe top role in South Korea, with em\\nphasis on promises to “march forward”\\nwith “reconstruction of the national\\neconomy and establishment of social\\nmorals.”\\nIncidentally, it should be noted, as\\nthe Associated Press has reported, that\\nGeneral Pak has been linked in the\\npast with the Reds. But his role in that\\nsense seems to have been shortlived. In\\nthe AP’s words, he “was actually under\\ndeath sentence at one time after a\\ncourt-martial convicted him of forming\\na Communist apparatus in the South\\nKorean army.” But he “won forgiveness\\nby turning over enough information to\\nenable the army to purge most of its\\nCommunists at the start of the Korean\\nconflict.” And he “has had an exemplary\\nrecord since.”\\nAnother reassuring fact is that\\nGeneral Pak has long had a close and\\nfriendly relationship with General Song,\\nwho is now Premier and whose oppo\\nsition to the Communists seems uncom\\npromising. In the circumstances, the\\nUnited States and the free world as a\\nwhole have ground for confidence that\\nthe latest political change in Seoul will\\ntend to strengthen, rather than weaken,\\nSouth Korea’s resistance to Red total\\nitarianism.\\n1\\nMr 7\\nQ If \"HSOF -\\n<=— <TAP,\\nPolitics . . . and Strikes . . .

We who\\nare too bored, or callous, or\\nfaint of heart to tackle the\\ntough problems of crime and\\npunishment and rehabilita\\ntion, say that such and such\\nmen, in certain situations,\\ncan kill a token few, prefer\\nably Negroes.\\nLet us make a beginning,\\nin this increasingly dehu\\nmanized world, in affirming\\nour sense of the sanctity of\\nhuman life, with these four\\nwretched men.

R.\\nTHE PASSING SCENE\\nBy RALPH McGILL\\nModern Berlin Is\\nThere is in all history no\\ncity-story comparable with\\nthat of Berlin. It covers an\\narea as large as the vast\\ncomplex of Los Angeles.\\nAbout 70 per cent of its\\nbuildings were destroyed by\\nWorld War H’s bombs and\\nshells.\\nWhen Allied Western\\ntroops entered it, it was a\\nsmoking, stinking pile of rub\\nble and huts. The stench was\\nprovided by dead bodies un\\nder the ruins and by the\\nwreckage of sewers and all\\nsanitation systems.\\nThe Russians had been\\nthere for 10 weeks. They had\\ndone a thorough job of re\\nmoving what the demolition\\nof war had missed. They took\\naway machines from the fac\\ntories, equipment from the\\npower stations, the undam\\naged trolleys and under\\nground trains, and most of\\nthe buses.\\nSo efficient was this So\\nviet \"liberation” of the phys\\nical remains that an esti\\nmated 92 per cent of all tools\\nand machines were taken\\nfrom the larger plants. This\\nincluded, for example, 52\\nautomatic, underground tele\\nphone exchanges, with a ca\\npacity of 250,000 lines, and\\nmost of the generators.\\nA further tribute to their\\nthoroughness was the fact\\nthat they made a .careful\\nsearch sos, found and took\\nthe blueprints, technical\\ndrawings, formulas and all\\nother such information from\\nthe files of the companies so\\nravaged.\\nThey kept what was needed\\nin their zone. The Americans,\\nBritish and French had the\\njob of supplying such equip\\nment for their own areas.\\nThe Break-Up Period\\nIn this period the four\\npowers were admitting they\\nhad co-operated to win the\\nwar. The assumption was\\nthere eventually would be a\\npeace treaty which would\\nproduce one Germany—not\\ntwo. Hence, it did not then\\nseem important that Berlin\\nwas wholly surrounded by\\nSoviet - occupied territory—\\nlater to become East\\nGermany.\\nThe Russians began to\\nhave doubts in late 1945.\\nMunicipal elections were\\nheld. Social Democrats won\\nmore than half the seats and\\nthe majority was heavily\\nanti-Communist. Soon there\\nafter the Soviets began to\\nwithdraw their zone of Ber\\nlin from control of the\\nelected magistrates.\\nBy 1947 the allied control\\nsystem had all but broken\\nVISTAS IN SCIENCE\\nBy THOMAS R. HENRY\\nMan\\'s Two Brains\\nHigher animals, including\\nman, have two brains. They\\nare almost, if not quite, in\\ndependent of each other.\\nExperiments demonstrat\\ning this have been reported\\nby Dr. R. W. Sperry of Cali\\nfornia Institute of Tech\\nnology through the American\\nAssociation for the Advance\\nment of Science.\\nRight and left halves of\\nthe brain duplicate each\\nother in all essential func\\ntions and in all essential\\nareas such as those of vision,\\nhearing, touch and taste. In\\nthe intact brain the two\\nhalves are joined by various\\nnerve fiber systems. When\\nthese are severed, however,\\nalmost no difference can be\\nfound in the ordinary behav\\nior of an animal.\\nOne half the brain seems\\nactually unaware of what the\\nother half is doing, or may\\ndo. This can be demonstrated\\nin the field of vision, for ex\\nample, by putting a patch\\nover one eye and training an\\nanimal to do various tasks\\nrequiring visual stimuli. Then\\nthe visual area in the cere\\nbral cortex on the side of\\nthe unobstructed eye is surg\\nically removed. The animal\\nno longer can make the re\\nsponses, or do the job, for\\nwhich it has been trained.\\nThere apparently has been\\nno transfer from one side of\\nthe brain to the other.\\nTransfer of Emotions\\nRegardless of severing of\\nthe nerve connections be\\ntween two sides of the brain,\\nhowever, there appears to be\\nsome transfer of emotions,\\nDr. Sperry says.\\n“Incidental obs e r vations\\nmade in the course of train\\ning and testing,” says the re\\nport, “suggest that milder as\\npects of emotional attitude\\nand temperament, like stub\\nbornness and sulkiness, can\\nbe confined to one side. It\\nmight be possible to make\\none of the separated hemi\\nspheres neurotic and leave the\\nother normal. Some animals\\nact normally fearful or fero\\ncious when using the eye con\\nnected with the intact hemi\\nsphere. but promptly become\\nmore tame, placid and gen\\nerally less touchy when the\\nlesion hemisphere is made\\ndominant by switching the\\nvisual occluder to the other\\neye.”\\n•** * ,\\nThere are bat fishermen.\\nThese flying mammals live\\nalmost exclusively on flsh ,\\nwhich they locate by means\\nof an inbuilt, air-borne sonar\\nsystem.\\nThis has been reported by\\nDr. J.

On\\nthat day the brilliant cur\\nrency reform plan went into\\neffect for West Germany.\\n(Gen. Lucius D. Clay’s com\\npetent administration as\\nmilitary governor has been\\nlargely obscured by subse\\nquent events.)

Today it is again\\na prosperous, glittering city.\\nRefugees pour into it from\\nthe East and after screening\\nare flown out into West\\nGermany. It provides a vivid\\ncontrast with the drabness of\\nEast Berlin. It is this which\\noffends. But it also is Berlin\\nwhich prevents an expansion\\nof total Communist control\\nand the clear establishment\\nof two Germanys.\\nThe West’s problem is\\nwhether to hold to what\\nseems like a fading possibil\\nity—that there can again be\\none Germany without a war\\nto make it so—or to find a\\nway to hold its area of Berlin\\nwhile accepting an East\\nGermany.\\n5 Think Alike\\nunderlie their design are be\\ning studied by Massachu\\nsetts Tech scientists.\\nOne of the very few bats\\nthat fish for a living, says\\nDr. McCue, is the noctilio\\nperorinus which inhabits\\nparts of the Caribbean area.\\nIt catches fish by gaffing\\nthem with well developed\\nclaws.\\nFear Full Moon\\n“This he does,” says the\\nreport, “by flying low over\\nthe water, dipping his feet\\nfrom time to time, and drag\\nging them for distances of\\na few inches to a few feet.\\nSome fraction of the time\\nthis dipping results in pull\\ning out a fish.”\\nThe bats, Dr. McCue says,\\navoid fishing on nights with\\na full moon because they\\nthemselves may be snatched\\nby much larger fish leaping\\nout of the water.

BRODER\\nStar Staff Writer\\nThe Senate today defeated\\ntwo minor amendments to the\\nschool aid bill,, then turned to\\ndebate the issue of how Fed\\neral funds should be shared\\namong the States.\\nThe manager of the bill,\\nSenator Morse, Democrat of\\nOregon, predicted the measure\\nwould pass next week “without\\nany crippling amendments.”\\nCalled into session at 9 am.\\n—three hours earlier than usual\\n—in an effort to speed action\\non the major Kennedy admin\\nistration proposal, the Sena\\ntors quickly disposed of two\\nrelatively unimportant amend\\nments.\\nThe first, offered by Senator\\nCotton, Republican of New\\nHampshire, was a substitute\\nwhich would have turned back\\nto each State 3 cents of the 8-\\ncent Federal tax on cigarettes\\nsold in that State. It was de\\nfeated, 63-29.\\nProxmire Also Loses\\nThe second amendment, by\\nSenator Proxmire, Democrat of\\nWisconsin, was beaten, 73-22.\\nIt was a technical change to\\nconvert the financing of the\\nbill from Federal grants to tax\\nsharing, without affecting the\\ndivision of funds among the\\nStates.\\nTwo Republicans, Senators\\nJavits of New York and Cooper\\nof Kentucky, then called up\\ntheir amendment which Would\\nbasically revise the committee\\napproved distribution formula.\\nThe chief differences be\\ntween the Cooper-Javits for\\nmula and the committee for\\nmula are:\\n1. The Cooper-Javits formula\\nis based on public school at\\ntendance, while the committee\\nformula is based on total school\\nage population.\\n2. The Cooper-Javits formula\\nwould provide S2O a year per\\npublic school pupil to all States, i\\nwith a bonus payment to low\\nincome States designed to bring\\nthe general Impression: “Ob\\nviously these meetings are go\\ning to last some time.”\\nA neutralist delegate reported\\nthat two American flyers and\\nan American television camera\\nman missing since their heli\\ncopter went down in rebel ter\\nritory are alive and well.\\nPresumably they are prison\\ners of the Pathet Lao. but\\nPathet Lao delegates said only\\nthey had not heard of the in\\ncident and would check.\\nSeen in Rice Field\\nThe Americans aboard the\\nhelicopter when it went down\\nMonday 50 miles northeast of\\nVientiane are NBC cameraman\\nGrant Wolfkill of Shelton,\\nWash., and Hong Kong; Pilot\\nEdward R. Shore of Gallaway,\\nTenn., and Flight Mechanic\\nJohn P. McMorrow of Brooklyn.\\nThe helicopter was spotted in\\na rice field, apparently undam\\naged, by air searchers Wednes\\nday.\\nFive other Americans have\\nbeen captured by the Pathet\\nLao, but the rebels have given\\nno direct word on them.\\nthem up to a \"minimum foun\\ndation standard” of education.\\nThe bonuses would go to seven\\nStates in the first year and 15\\nStates in the third year of the\\nprogram. The range of pay\\nments in the third year would\\nbe S2O per public school pupil\\nto $65.48.\\nThe committee formula, by\\ncontrast, calls for a gradual\\nincrease in payments per\\nschool-age child between the\\nvery rich and very poor States.\\nThe range in all three years\\nwould be from $9.26 per school\\nage child to $27.79.\\n3. The Cooper-Javits for\\nmula would increase the share\\nof Federal funds that would go\\nto 14 States and the District of\\nI Columbia.

P. news dispatches.\\nA-4\\nFull Representation\\nThere is a practical advantage, we\\nsuppose, in the argument of Senator\\nKeating of New York that congressional\\nrepresentation for the District of Colum\\nbia should be restricted to the House\\nof Representatives. For while the House\\nrefused to go along, the Senate two\\nyears ago accepted this limited form\\nof representation during the preliminary\\nvoting on the constitutional amendment\\nwhich has granted Washingtonians the\\nright to vote for President and Vice\\nPresident.\\nBut Senator Bush of Connecticut\\nis entirely right when he says that this\\nis not enough, that District residents\\nwill attain the full rights of citizenship\\ndue them only when they achieve vot\\ning representation in the Senate as well\\nas in the House. And it is refreshing to\\nnear this right upheld in so candid and\\nforthright a manner.\\nIn time, we have no doubt that\\nWashingtonians will gain their full\\nmeasure of enfranchisement. The\\namendment to the Constitution which\\nhas enabled them to vote for President\\nin 1964 is a gratifying and long-delayed\\nfirst step. If now a second amendment\\non voting rights were limited to rep\\nresentation in the House, a third in\\nevitably would follow to encompass the\\nSenate at some date in the future. It\\nwould be too bad to have to invoke the\\ndifficult and complex procedures of\\nconstitutional amendment in three\\nbites, when two would suffice.\\nNo Mitigating Factor\\nDistrict Court Judge McGarraghy\\nused justifiably strong language in re\\nfusing to reduce the death sentence\\nimposed on William Coleman for the\\nmurder of a policeman following a\\nliquor store robbery in 1960. Recalling\\nthat the Court of Appeals, in upholding\\n.the conviction, described the killing as\\na “savage and desperate” attempt by\\nColeman to shoot his way past the\\nOfficer in an alley, Judge McGarraghy\\nadded succinctly: “Undoubtedly, more\\nrevolting killings are conceivable, but\\nthat fact does not of Itself constitute\\na mitigating circumstance.”\\nColeman was convicted of wresting\\nthe officer’s gun away from him when\\nthe latter trapped him outside the\\nliquor store immediately after the hold\\nup, in which another policeman was\\nshot. He turned the gun against the\\nofficer, fatally wounding him. Cole\\nman\\'s attorney appealed the conviction\\nin vain to the Court of Appeals and\\nthe Supreme Court. Then came a plea\\nfor reduction of sentence, based largely\\non the ground that since the Imposition\\nof the death sentence a new law has\\nmade it discretionary with juries as to\\nwhether execution or a life sentence\\nis the penalty for first degree murder.\\n“Police officers,” Judge McGarraghy\\nsaid, “are engaged in the dangerous\\nbusiness of protecting the public from\\nvicious criminals. When they become\\nthe victims of such criminals, the pub\\nlic interest, both from the point of view\\nof deterrence and of punishment, re\\nquires that the penalty fixed by law\\nbe carried into effect.” This is sound\\ndoctrine.\\nLibrary for the Nation\\nThe Nation and its historians are\\nthe true beneficiaries of dedication\\nceremonies recently on the outskirts\\nof the little Kansas town of Abilene.\\nFor it was there that the latest of pres\\nidential libraries, a storehouse of records\\nand papers relating not only to eight\\nyears of a national administration but\\nto an earlier span of momentous mili\\ntary events, was handed over officially\\nto the keeping of the Federal Govern\\nment.\\nThis was the Eisenhower Library,\\nan impressive new structure that dom\\ninates a 13-acre site also containing the\\nboyhood home of the soldier-President.\\nCitizens of fifty States contributed to\\nthe financing of this future center of\\nstudy and research, to be administered\\nhenceforth by the National Archives\\nService of the General Services Admin\\nistration. Already on its miles of shelves\\nare films and documents supplementing\\nother Government and public records of\\npolicy-making and action-taking during\\nGeneral Eisenhower\\'s two terms in the\\nPresidency. The files of other members\\nof iiis official family, including those of\\nthf late Secretary of State John Foster\\nDulles, will be added. And of greatly\\nadded value in this case will be many\\nof General Eisenhower\\'s papers from the\\nSATURDAY, MAY 26, 1962\\nWorld War II period, including some of\\nhis own, and some of his military staff\\nmembers, still bearing top secret class\\nification.\\nThe worth of this manner of bring\\ning together the most detailed and per\\nsonal of a President’s records already\\nhas been well demonstrated and it has,\\nin fact, been improved and expanded in\\nmodem times. On the campus of Stan\\nford University in Palo Alto, California,\\nthe Hoover Library has become recog\\nnized as a highly useful research center.\\nThe same applies to the F. D. Roosevelt\\nLibrary in Hyde Park, N. Y., and even\\nmore complete as a source for study of\\nthe years involved is the Truman Library\\nin Independence, Missouri. The Eisen\\nhower Library is a valuable addition to\\nthis distinguished group.\\nIt\\'s Greener Here\\nFor some eight years, although as\\nsertedly not a member of the party,\\nDavid Paul Johnson had been an active\\nCommunist sympathizer in Philadelphia.\\nThe Soviet Union, he was convinced at\\nthe time, grew grass much greener than\\nAmerica’s.\\nSo 32-year-old Mr. Johnson, with\\nideological stars in his eyes, decided just\\na short time ago to give up his railroad\\njob (it paid him over sllO a week), sell\\nhis possessions and set sail with his\\nfamily for the Marxist-Leninist para\\ndise of the USSR. His Intention was to\\nsettle down over there and begin a new\\nlife. This life, he was sure—having in\\nmind all the glowing party-line litera\\nture he had devoured avidly and with\\nrelish—would be far better than his\\nbourgeois existence in Philadelphia.\\nWell, once he arrived in the USSR,\\nMr. Johnson, whose wife and children\\napparently were never particularly\\neager to leave their home in the City\\nof Brotherly Love, learned fast. In fact,\\nwithin one week after arriving in Len\\ningrad, he knew that he had made “an\\nexceptionally tragic mistake.” He noted\\nright away that the Soviet Union was\\nnot in any sense comparable to the land\\nof his dreams, and his erstwhile party\\nline enchantment soon changed into\\nutter disenchantment.\\nThus, looking around over there,\\nMr. Johnson discovered almost imme\\ndiately that the consumer-goods situa\\ntion (including food) was bad and that\\nhousing was unbelievably scarce. Also,\\nsome people on the streets wanted to\\nbuy the clothes he wore. All the Soviet\\npropaganda of the past, the stuff he had\\naccepted as gospel truth, suddenly fell\\napart before his eyes. Now with the\\nnaivete gone from his mind, he recog\\nnized the whole business as a colossal\\nlie that had bamboozled him.\\nIn sum, what Mr. Johnson has\\nlearned is that American grass, in terms\\nof individual freedom and personal liv\\ning standards, is incomparably greener\\nthan Red Russia’s. His eyes have been\\nopened wide on that score, and so let us\\nwelcome him back as a man who has\\nfrankly admitted his quite foolish\\nmistake.\\nTories on Defense\\nLocal elections in England and\\nWales in recent weeks have produced one\\nloser and two winners. The loser, not\\nunexpectedly, was the Conservative\\nParty, which suffered a net loss of more\\nthan 500 seats in the municipal councils\\nof 428 boroughs. One winner, fully in\\nkeeping with the seesaw movement of\\ntwo-party political strength in Britain\\nfor more than 40 years past, was the\\nLabor Party, which scored net gains of\\napproximately 260 seats. The other win\\nner, and the one that may represent a\\ntruly new force in modern British poli\\ntics (meaning since World War I), was\\nthe Liberal Party, which picked up a\\nnet of at least 325 seats.\\nIn the working of British politics,\\nthe results of these local elections do\\nnot necessarily affect policies of the na\\ntional government—which has been\\nConservative since 1951—and which may\\nnot be forced to the test of a general\\nelection until the fall of 1964. Further\\nmore, with a party margin of more\\nthan 100 votes in the House of Com\\nmons, the Conservative government is\\nreasonably insured against a Parliamen\\ntary defeat that might force earlier\\nelections. Even so, as a practical matter,\\nthe local voting shows quite clearly that\\nthere is at least a public restiveness\\nabout the Conservative stewardship, and\\nthat simply moving to Labor leadership\\nis less than the complete answer.\\nIt is noteworthy that the local elec\\ntions were fought out almost entirely on\\ndomestic issues—among them the Con\\nservative government’s deflationary\\nbudget, the fact that Britain’s economy\\ncurrently is marking time while that\\nof continental Western Europe is more\\nbuoyant, and a subtle annoyance—taken\\nout on the Conservatives—that Britain’s\\nbid to join the Common Market has not\\ndrawn prompt and unconditional ap\\nproval by the Common Market members.\\nThe English-Welsh voting indicates a\\nnew impatience with both of the major\\nparties.\\nActually, the Liberal Party Itself\\ndoes not offer very concrete alterna\\ntives. In some respects it is to the left\\nof the Labor Party, in others to the\\nright. The Economist speaks of the\\n“muzziness” of certain Liberal policy\\npositions, and even the party leadership,\\nis quoted equivocally about being against\\nnationalization but in favor of democ\\nratization, encouraging free enterprise\\nbut favoring stronger curbs on concen\\ntration of business power, and so on.\\nThere is some reason to believe, in fact,\\nthat the Liberal leadership is delighted\\nwith the party’s new popularity but not\\nquite sure what to do about it. In this\\ncircumstance, there are no serious fore\\ncasts now that the Liberals might win\\na general election in 1964, or sooner if\\nthere is an earlier test. As a third choice,\\nhowever, the party could exercise a\\nbalance of power and be a major in\\nfluence upon the behavior of its two\\nstronger rivals.\\n—WE)\\n\\'Enjoying My Old Office, Mike?\\'\\nLETTERS TO THE STAR\\nFeeding Red China\\nDisturbing to this reader is\\nthe growing sentiment that\\nthe United States should sup\\nply food to the starving\\nmasses in Red China on a\\nhumanitarian level. Empha\\nsized is the fact that there\\nare unfortunate millions suf\\nfering the pangs of hunger\\nwhile we enjoy the benefit of\\nunmeasured surplus; inher\\nent in the argument is an\\nemotional appeal which all\\nbut obliterates a reflective\\nconsideration of the conse\\nquences of such a program\\nof aid.\\nIgnored in the typical com\\nmentary of this sort is the\\nfact that Red China, no less\\nthan Russia, represents not\\nonly a potential, but a very\\nreal kinetic enemy ideologi\\ncally. militarily, economical\\nly. How easy to offer an\\nappeal to sympathy on the\\nbasis of pure emotion while\\nomitting mention that this\\nsame nation daily drives\\ndeeper into Vietnam, into\\nLaos.\\nThe real tragedy of the\\nsituation is not that the Chi\\nnese are hungry, but rather\\nlies in the fact that these\\nsame people must be associ\\nated with a government,\\nwhich may or may not repre\\nsent their true personal senti\\nment, in such away as to ren\\nder the possibility of such aid\\na nullity. If it were possible\\nto separate a consideration\\nof the people themselves from\\ntheir identification with the\\ngovernment, the suggestion\\nof such direct relief might\\nwell be considered. Sad to\\nsay, such a distinction is\\nrealistically impossible.\\nWe are in a tortuous po\\nsition of having to balance a\\nconsideration of the needs of\\nsuffering individuals, against\\nthe long-range effect of such\\naid. Our leanings are imme\\ndiately to help anyone, on a\\npersonal basis, who so obvi\\nously needs what we enjoy in\\nsurplus. What is necessary\\nalso, however, is a mature\\nreflection on the results of\\nour good will.\\nTrue, there are individuals\\nsuffering from starvation;\\ntrue we have food we can\\nsend. Unfortunately, it is\\ntrue also that the govern\\nment of Red China derives its\\nstrength and vitality from\\nthese people and that we are\\nface-to-face, hot and cold,\\nwith this government which\\nhas continuously pronounced\\na policy of inevitable con\\nflict with the West.\\nRegardless of how inhu\\nmane it may seem, we are in\\nsuch a position that our\\nhands are tied we cannot\\ngive aid of this sort without\\nunwittingly bolstering, to\\nsome degree, the basis of a\\ngovernment committed to\\nour suppression, if not de\\nstruction.\\nEdward P.

I think the definition of\\n“right-winger” depends upon\\nthe position between the\\npoles from where the term\\nemanates. The Democrats’\\nviewpoint exists because they\\nhave “progressed” so far to\\nthe left ... so far that any\\nthing contrary to ADA belief\\nis considered “right wing.”\\nOn second throught, the\\ncaption isn’t so amusing.

A\\nCommunist force of rebel\\nLaotians copiously augmented\\nby Red Chinese and North\\nVietnamese troops, not to\\nmention Russian planes, un\\ndertook full-scale military\\noperations and conquered the\\ncountry.\\nYet, our State Department\\nhad pinpointed a totally dif\\nferent enemy—poverty and\\nindifference.

P.\\'s Tall Hope in Missouri\\nMany Republicans in Mis\\nsouri are basing their hopes\\nfor victory in the November\\nsenatorial election on a 6-\\nfoot, 7*4-lnch-tall, 35-year\\nold president of one of Kan\\nsas City’s largest banks. He\\nis Crosby Kemper, and his\\nbank is the City National\\nBank and Trust Co. For eight\\nmonths this tall young man\\nhas been campaigning all\\nover the State and has visited\\n65 counties. First he must\\nwin the senatorial nomina\\ntion in a primary election\\nAugust 7. He has four op\\nponents, but his own view\\nand that of more impartial\\nobservers is that he is sure\\nto win. Then will come the\\nmuch more difficult task of\\ndefeating the Democratic\\ncandidate who will be incum\\nbent Senator Edward V. Long,\\nformer Lieutenant Governor.\\nSenator Long was appointed\\nin September, 1960 to fill the\\nvacancy caused by the death\\nof the late Thomas C. Hen\\nnings and in November was\\nelected to fill out Senator\\nHenning’s unexpired term. He\\nhails from Clarksville, a\\nlawyer and no stranger to\\npolitics, having served in\\nthe Missouri legislature and\\nwon election as Lieutenant\\nGovernor in 1956.\\nCapturing a United States\\nSenate seat in Missouri is\\nnot an impossible task for\\nthe Republicans. But it is\\na tough one. The State is\\ngenerally considered Demo\\ncratic today. Nevertheless,\\nin 1950, a dozen years ago,\\ntwo Republicans from Mis\\nsouri sat in the Senate. The\\nlast one to be defeated for\\nre-election was Senator\\nJames Preston Kem, who lost\\nto Democratic Senator Stuart\\nSymington. If the G. O. P.\\nsucceeds in the coming sen\\natorial election, the line will\\nbe “from Kem to Kemper.”\\nDislikes Democratic Program\\nMr. Kemper was formerly\\na Democrat treasurer, in\\ndeed, for Senator Syming\\nton’s successful campaign for\\nre-election in 1958. It wasn’t\\nlong after that, however,\\nthat he decided he could\\ncould not go along with the\\nNew Deal and Fair Deal tenets\\nof the majority wing of the\\nDemocratic Party. He likes\\nthe Kennedy New Frontier\\nprograms even less. A grand\\nfather, he was for some time\\ntime Democratic National\\nCommitteeman for Missouri.\\nHis father and an uncle—\\nwho heads another success\\nful bank in Kansas City\\nare both Democrats, although\\nhis father, also Crosby Kem\\nper, is backing Mr. Kemper\\nin his present try for the\\nSenate.\\nMr. Kemper, in his trav\\nels about the State, is ap\\npealing to both Democrats\\nand Republicans for support.\\nHe stresses the Importance\\nVISTAS IN SCIENCE\\nBy THOMAS R. HENRY\\nFacets of Space Exploring Program\\nA cubic inch of the stuff\\nthat forms the nuclei of\\natoms would weigh about\\n1 billion tons.\\nFour basic forces hold cre\\nation together. Men are fa\\nmiliar with two of them—\\ngravity and magnetism. They\\nare puny forces Indeed com\\npared to the mighty and still\\nmysterious “nuclear force”\\nthat binds protons and neu\\ntrons down in the ultimate\\ndepths of matter.\\nThe basic mechanisms and\\norigin of all these forces re\\nmain essentially unknown.\\nThey must be accepted as\\npart of the basic scheme of\\nthings as they are. Prospects\\nof studying them on a big\\nscale are just now opening\\nwith the space exploration\\nprogram of the scientists of\\nthe Goddard Space Flight\\nCenter of the National Aero\\nnautics and Space Adminis\\ntration.\\nConsiderably more is\\nknown, up to now, of electro\\nmagnetic forces which hold\\nelectrons in their planetary\\npositions in atoms. They are\\nless than 100th as strong as\\nthe nuclear forces. There is\\na so - called Fermi force,\\nnamed for the great Italian\\nphysicist, which is about half\\nway between electromagne\\ntism and gravity and which,\\nat present, enters very little\\ninto space calculations.\\nGravity’s Force Puny\\nBest known to man is\\ngravity the attraction be\\ntween masses, that which\\ncauses an apple to fall, that\\nwhich keeps earth and plan\\nets in their places, which\\nwould appear to be the su\\npreme law of the physical\\nuniverse. Actually, some of\\nthe calculationshy space sci\\nentists show, it is relatively\\na very puny force indeed.\\nThe actual weakness of\\ngravity is easily illustrated.\\nA chunk of iron weighs 3\\npounds. That is equivalent\\nto saying that the entire\\nearth pulls on it with a total\\nforce of 3 pounds. The\\nsame force is exerted by a\\nquite small magnet. It will\\nkeep the iron from falling.\\nThere is no reason, how\\never, to discount this rela\\ntively puny gravity. That of\\nthe earth, for example, pulls\\non the moon with a total\\naverage force of about 22\\nquadrillion tons. It holds\\nthe moon in its orbit as\\nwell as causing an apple\\nto fall. The earth’s gravita\\ntional field also holds the\\nof a Republican Congress as\\na check on the policies and\\nprograms of the Kennedy ad\\nministration. \"I’m against\\nthe socialistic power state\\nwhich the President and his\\nprograms will surely bring to\\nthis country,” he tells the\\npeople. Then he attacks in\\ndetail much of the legisla\\ntion which the administra\\ntion is sponsoring, and also\\nits big spending programs.\\nThe towering young Sen\\nate candidate is a good mix\\ner and speaker—an attrac\\ntive personality. A graduate\\nof the University of Missouri,\\nhe served in the Navy (he\\nenlisted as soon as he\\nreached enlistment age) dur\\ning the last two years of the\\nSecond World War. He is\\nmarried, and his wife, he con\\nfides, is a Republican. They\\nhave three children.\\nStrong Support Ready\\nDuring his eight months of\\ncampaigning, Mr. Kemper\\nhas been building an organ\\nization. If he wins the nom\\nination, as now is confi\\ndently expected, he will have\\nstrong support of the Repub\\nlican Senatorial Campaign\\nCommittee and also of the\\nRepublican National Com\\nmittee. In 1960, President\\nKennedy just squeaked\\nthrough in Missouri, carry\\ning the State by a scant\\n10,000 votes over former Vice\\nPresident Nixon. This despite\\nall that former President\\nHarry S. Truman could do.\\nHowever, the Democrats\\nelected a Governor that year\\n—John M. Dalton—by a very\\nmaterial vote, And Senator\\nLong was elected with a lead\\nof 119,000 votes over his Re\\npublican opponent.\\nThe Democrats are pre\\ndicting the re-election of\\nSenator Long. His is not a\\nseat they regard as in any\\nreal jeopardy. Furthermore,\\nthey would hate to lose it.\\nHe will have the backing of\\nthe Democratic organization.\\nHowever, Mr. Kemper comes\\nof an old, influential family\\nin Kansas City at the west\\nern side of the State and the\\nRepublicans have been pick\\ning up strength in St. Louis\\nat the eastern side. Mr. Kem\\nper feels he will do well in\\nthat area.\\nBreaking the Democratic\\nhold in Missouri, if the Ken\\nnedy administration is riding\\nhigh when November rolls\\naround, will be no easy task.\\nAt present the State has a\\nDemocratic Governor, two\\nDemocratic Senators and\\nnine Democrats to two Re\\npublicans in its congressional\\ndelegation. But this does not.\\ndaunt Mr. Kemper. If he\\nshould win, he will add an\\nother young’ Senator to a\\ngrowing list. He insists he\\nwill be no rubber stamp Sen\\nator—which he charges Sen\\nator Long is.\\nsatellites in their orbits.\\nThey can be considered only\\nas artificial moons.\\nThere is considerably less\\ncommon experience with\\nmagnetic forces. The mag\\nnetic field of the earth,\\nwhich is believed to be\\ncreated by electric currents\\ncirculating deep in the core\\nof the earth, has much the\\nsame shape as that of a toy\\nbtir magnet. Presumably the\\nsame holds throughout na\\nture. The behavior of satel\\nlites launched by the Na\\ntional Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration is expected\\nto make possible mapping of\\nthese fields.\\nFinally, electric charges\\ngive rise to electric force\\nfields, similar to magnetic\\nfields, in the regions of space\\nsurrounding them. Little is\\nknown, to date, of their\\nsignificance.\\nNuclear Forces Different\\nThe extremely powerful\\nnuclear forces are something\\nquite different. With them\\nmany can have no direct sen\\nsory experience and the\\nphysicist can investigate\\nthem only to a quite lim\\nited extent in the laboratory.\\nThey come into play .in the\\ninnermost heart of the atom,\\nin the explosions of atomic\\nnuclei such as will be found\\nin the dreaded nuclear bomb\\nof predicted future wars which\\nwould eliminate mankind,\\nand in production of most\\nof the radiant energy of the\\nsun and stars. The enormous\\ndestructive power calculated\\nfor the bombs is not surpris\\ning when the force involved is\\nconsidered.\\nIt is an interplay between\\nthe very weak and very\\nstrong forces in nature that\\nis responsible for the birth\\nand evolution of the stars\\nand galaxies.

P. newt dispatches.\\nA-12\\nWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1962\\nCuba and the U. N.\\nThe state of the world being what\\nIt Is, and the United Nations having long\\nsince become a sounding board for the\\nmost outrageous kind of propaganda,\\nthere is nothing particularly astonish\\ning about the windy, low-level harangue\\njust addressed to the General Assembly\\nby President Dortlcos of Communist\\nCuba. Beyond that, one may say that\\nthe grossness of his performance, its\\ncoarseness, constitutes yet another re\\nvealing but not surprising measure of\\nthe noisome character of Fidel Castro\\'s\\nKremlin-serving tyranny in Havana.\\nAccordingly, our U. N. Ambassador\\nAdlai Stevenson has not exaggerated in\\nassailing it as a contemptible melange\\nof “unparalleled calumnies, slanders\\nand misrepresentations.” It is a speech\\nwhich leaves little room for doubt that\\nCuba’s \"chief of state” has staged his\\nugly little act before the General As\\nsembly with the complete blessing and\\nbehind - the - scenes direction of our\\nfriends In the Kremlin.\\nAll of which makes a kind of farce\\nof what Mr. Dorticos has said. And this\\napplies especially to his demand that\\nthe General Assembly formally “con\\ndemn” our country for its “aggressive\\nacts” against Cuba. Needless to say, If\\neven a sizeable number of members\\nshould vote in favor of such action, the\\nU. N.—whose very existence depends In\\nlarge measure upon the help our coun\\ntry Is giving It—would almost certainly\\ndie a quite sudden death. And deservedly.\\nTry, Try Again\\n* The House and the Senate now have\\nresolved the first phase of the Franklin\\nDelano Roosevelt Memorial controversy\\nwith celerity and sound judgment. We\\nhope, as a result, that nothing more will\\nbe heard of the strange agglomeration of\\ntowering concrete slabs which the Roose\\nvelt Memorial Commission had proposed\\nto erect in West Potomac Park —an\\narchitectural creation which would have\\nbeen appropriate neither to that area\\nnor, as Representative James Roosevelt\\nstated In the House debate, to the mem\\nory of the former President.\\nIn rejecting this design, however,\\nthe new act wisely affords the Me\\nmorial Commission wide latitude in its\\nsearch for a more fitting memorial, and\\nauthorizes the funds necessary to ac\\ncomplish the job. It Is well, also, that\\nthe act requires the commission to ob\\ntain the concurrence of the Fine Arts\\nCommission before submitting an al\\nternative proposal, a condition which\\nshould minimize the likelihood of furth\\ner public controversy once an agreement\\nIs reached.\\nDecision in Poolesville\\nThe controversy over whether to\\nretain the rural small-town flavor of\\nPoolesville, Md., or to seek a solution to\\nIts very real problems through the popu\\nlar expedient of annexation was the\\nbusiness of the residents of that tiny\\nMontgomery County community. Their\\ndecision to reject the annexation pro\\nposal, by the conclusive margin of 101\\nvotes to 74, was a courageous one. The\\ntown can take a high degree of pride,\\nmoreover, In the fact that only 11 reg\\nistered voters failed to appear at the\\npolls on referendum day.\\nWhile it was theirs to make, however,\\nthe decision should be widely applauded\\nin Montgomery County as a whole. For\\nthe suburban development planned by\\nprivate Investors in the five square miles\\nproposed for annexation conflicts with\\nboth the Year 2000 Plan for the region\\nand the general outlines of the master\\nplan for Montgomery County which has\\nbeen proposed by the staff of the Mary\\nland-National Capital Park and Plan\\nning Commission. Admittedly the coun\\nty-wide plan has not yet been adopted,\\nor even refined in specific’ detail. Still,\\nIt would have been unfortunate if,\\nthrough annexation, this large and\\nstrategic area had been removed from\\nall county land-use control during this\\ncritical period of the plan’s development.\\nIndeed, the Poolesville case illus\\ntrates a manner by which effective\\ncounty planning can be (and, unfor\\ntunately, In some Instances Is being)\\nsubverted through constant annexation.\\nWhat good Is a county plan, no matter\\nhow widely accepted by the region as a\\nwhole, If strategic portions of the county\\ncan be fragmented through annexation\\nby towns and cities which are capable\\nunder existing law of exercising develop\\nment controls without regard for their\\nImpact on the\\'larger area? In view of\\nmounting concern about this question,\\nthe Planning Commission staff has sug\\ngested State legislation which would\\nspecify that the county retain zoning,\\nplanning and subdivision controls over\\nall areas which may be annexed in the\\nfuture. Such legislation of course would\\nbe difficult to obtain. The problem is\\nan important one, which should be fully\\nexplored at the public hearings which\\nwill be held on the new county plan\\nduring the next several months.\\nHistoric Church Council\\nThoughtful persons of every reli\\ngious faith will follow with interest one\\nof the most impressive church conclaves\\nof all time, the Ecumenical Council\\ncalled by Pope John XXIII in Rome. As\\noutlined by this far-sighted head of the\\nRoman Catholic Church, the council’s\\ndebates and decisions will have mean\\ning beyond the scope of the church\\nitself.\\nNinety years have gone by since the\\nlast Vatican Council, years in which\\ncommunism has nibbled away at the\\nfoundation of religion in many areas.\\nNone has battled more assiduously\\nagainst this evil than the Vatican. And\\nthree months after his coronation, Pope\\nbJohn called another council to “provide\\nthe light of great example.”\\nDespite Soviet atheism, or perhaps\\nbecause of it, religion still has moved\\nforward in the Free World. Os utmost\\nimportance to all faiths is the highest\\nideal underlining the council call—the\\nPontiff’s hope for unity of 538 million\\nRoman Catholics with 138 million of\\nthe Eastern Orthodox Churches and 215\\nmillion Protestants.\\nLooking to this goal, Pope John set\\nup a Secretariat for Promoting Christian\\nUnity more than two years ago. Only\\nthe most sanguine believe such unity\\ncould emerge directly from the Ecumen\\nical. But the encouraging point is that\\na start is being made, and as Augustin\\nCardinal Bea, the inexhaustible 81-year\\nold German Jesuit, said, the council\\ncould “prepare for an eventual union,\\nGod willing, by bettering relations be\\ntween Catholic and non-Catholic Chris\\ntians.”\\nIt is obvious that basic beliefs, the\\nbeliefs affirmed by Martin Luther and\\nothers, still are poles apart from Cath\\nolic doctrine. But even as some Prot\\nestant churches have been uniting in\\nthis country, Pope John hopes for a start\\ntoward total unity by bringing the Ro\\nman Catholic church closer to the East\\nern Orthodox. Many Protestant church\\nmen believe eventual unity is possible\\nonly through the World Council of\\nChurches.\\nPerhaps most significant is the fact\\nthat, whereas 90 years ago there were\\nno Protestant observers at the Ecumen\\nical, 100 official and unofficial observers\\nwill attend this session. Another inter\\nesting development is the co-operation\\namong Catholics and Jews, the latter\\n“exploring ways Jews might observe or\\ncontribute to the success” of the council.\\nThe council is expected to issue a clear\\nstatement denouncing anti-semitism.\\nJoining the nearly 3,000 Catholic\\nchurchmen from all parts of the world\\nwill be five cardinals, 30 archbishops\\nand 185 bishops from America. Os that\\nnumber, delegates from Washington and\\nCatholic University will play an im\\nportant part. All of them carry our best,\\nwishes for success.\\nShorter Soviet Rations\\nOnce again Soviet leaders are\\nobliged to confess to their own people\\n—and for them, this is not easy—that\\nvisions of eating high off the hog are\\npremature. For the fourth straight\\nyear, something has gone wrong with\\nthe virgin land wheat crop, Premier\\nKhrushchev’s own baby, and a main\\nstay in his boast that one day Russian\\ntables would be as loaded as ours.\\nThere isn’t much new in the central\\ntheme of a familiar script. As usual\\nthe farmers cut their grain in windrows\\nto dry, expecting combines to come\\nalong, gather and thresh- it. Even if\\nthis is not the American way, it might\\nhave produced some results but for one\\noversight. The combines, thousands of\\nthem rusting in the fields, did not show\\nup. Reason? Chiefly no spare parts. So\\nmuch of the grain rotted in the rows.\\nIt is an old, sad story. With all\\ntheir know-how, their successes in space,\\ntheir armaments build-up, their stress\\non industrial development, the Russians\\nhave never acquired the capacity for\\nmaking the farm program work. While\\npushing for more farm machinery, they\\nhave neglected to supply spare parts\\nfor that already available.\\nOs course this is only the most\\nimmediate cause of failure. Basically,\\nthe program is tortured by collectivi\\nzation and state farm methods, which\\nthe peasants still resist. American ob\\nservers have found that on one 18,000-\\nacre farm, supporting 4,000 persons,\\nthere were 1,050 “workers.” But only\\n100 were working, tha others “fiddling\\naround.”\\nEven Mr. Khrushchev has admitted\\nthat Russian farming methods are in\\nferior to ours, and he has had his\\nminister of agriculture take a month’s\\ntour of the United States to soak up\\nsome of our reasons for over-abundance.\\nEven if Mr. K. G. Pysin has absorbed\\na great deal, there is no reason to be\\nlieve this knowledge can be readily\\napplied to collectivized or state farms,\\nwhere individual incentive is wanting.\\nThe farming effort by nearly half the\\nRussian population has been unable to\\napproach the agricultural production\\nof 8.6 per cent of our people.\\nDespite cajolery and hectoring by\\nMr. Khrushchev and others, Russian\\nproductivity is no more than holding\\neven, and with the latest disaster, may\\nbe slipping back. And because of a\\nbreakdown in plowing, the portents for\\nnext year’s crop are just as grim. Small\\nwonder the Soviet bosses sometimes\\ndespair to the point of trying to copy\\nthe decadent capitalists.\\n\\\\\\\\ \\\\ \\\\\\\\ \\\\’ i ; n \\'/ v/ /\\n■\\nThe Cost of Political Living Reaches an All-Time High\\nLETTERS TO THE STAR\\nLow and Disorder\\nReading the letters which\\nappeared in the Oct. 3. edi\\ntion of The Star, it seemed\\nto me that the writers on the\\nsubject of the recent events\\nin OJe Miss did not put the\\nsituation in its proper per\\nspective Much emphasis\\nwas put on the theory that\\nthe university wm forced by\\nthe Federal Government to\\nadmit Meredith and conse\\nquently there arose the riots\\nand violence. Furthermore\\nthere were some hints that\\nPresident Kennedy did the\\nforcing. Nothing of the kind\\nhappened.\\nThe Federal Courts, both\\nin Washington and New Or\\nleans ordered the admission\\nof Meredith to the university,\\nwhich order the Governor\\ntreated as a scrap of paper;\\nand he snubbed the court in\\nNew Orleans (incidentally\\nmade up in its entirety of\\nSoutherners, who made their\\ndecision in accordance with\\nthe law of the land, and were\\nnot influenced by their per\\nsonal feelings or emotions).\\nThese are the same men\\nwhose motives along with\\nthose of our President were\\nimpugned and their integrity\\nquestioned by Senator Byrd\\nof Virginia, who charged col\\nlusion between the court and\\nthe President to force the ad\\nmission of Meredith. This is\\na gratuitous insult to the\\ncourt and to the President,\\nwho performed his duty and\\nresponsibility as the Chief\\nExecutive, imposed upon him\\nby his oath of office and the\\nConstitution of this country,\\nto see to it that the law of\\nthe land is to be obeyed. The\\nGovernor on the other hand\\nthought that he could be a\\nlaw unto himself, disregard\\ning entirely the basic princi\\nple Os freedom and democra\\ncy, that the law is no re\\nspecter of person or rank\\nequal justice under the law.\\nThis act of placing himself\\nabove the law could lead\\nonly to chaos and violence,\\nas was proved by the events\\non the Mississippi campus.\\nAbe Shefferman\\n♦» » »\\nBecause James Meredith\\nsought to enter the Univer\\nsity of Mississippi, a State in\\nstitution, and such entry was\\ndenied him by the State of\\nMississippi, even to the extent\\nof direct action by the Gov\\nernor. everyone must admit\\nthat the controversy, regard\\nless of the, merits of either\\nside. Involved a State. Section\\n3, Article 111 of the Consti\\ntution of the United States\\nstates \"The judicial power\\nshall extend to all cases, in\\nlaw and equity, arising under\\nthis Constitution . . .” and\\n“In all cases ... in which a\\nState shall be party, the\\nSupreme Court shall have\\noriginal jurisdiction.”\\nThe case was not tried\\nbefore the Supreme Court.\\nNo other court of the United\\nStates could, under the Con\\nstitution, have jurisdiction,\\nnor has the President such\\njurisdiction. The method pre\\nscribed in the Constitution is\\nclear, but was not followed.\\nMessrs. John and Robert\\nKennedy have extended their\\npowers far beyond Consti\\ntutional limits.\\nAlso, Section 8, Article I of\\nthe Constitution gives Con\\ngress power \"To provide for\\ncalling forth the militia .to\\nexecute the laws of the Union,\\nsuppress insurrections . . .”\\nCertainly, Congress has\\npassed no law covering the\\nsituation at hand (Meredith\\nvs. Mississippi) and. if it had,\\nthere would be a serious ques\\ntion as to its Constitution\\nality, in view or what are\\nsupposed to be States’ rights\\nunder the Tenth Amendment.\\nIn addition, interpretations\\nand verdicts of Federal courts\\nInferior to the Supreme Court\\nin this matter are of no\\nstatus since the controversy\\nInvolves a State (see above).\\nFurther, opposition by the\\nState of Mississippi to these\\nunconstitutional Federal\\ncourt decisions and orders\\ndoes not constitute insur\\nrection Perhaps the activities\\n*of Gen. Walker may yet be\\ninterpreted\" as insurrection,\\nbut that will have to be\\ndecided by a due process of\\nlaw. if the matter is pursued.\\nIt, therefore, appears that\\nwith respect to Meredith vs.\\nPen names may be used if\\nletters carry writers’ correct\\nnames and addresses. All let\\nters are subject to condensa\\ntion. Those not used will be\\nreturned only when accom\\npanied by self • addressed,\\nstamped envelopes.\\nMississippi, the use of the\\nmilitia by the Federal Gov\\nernment was seriously im\\nproper. However, lest there be\\nany doubt, the answer is\\nclearly given by the Second\\nAmendment to the Consti\\ntution “A well regulated\\nmilitia, being necessary to the\\nsecurity of a free State, the\\nright of the people to keep\\nand bear arms, shall not be\\ninfringed.” When President\\nKennedy federalized the Mis\\nsissippi National Guard (mili\\ntia) for the purpose he did\\nand not for the protection of\\nthe United States during a\\nwar, he patently violated the\\nConstitution. How could Gov.\\nBarnett have contended with\\na serious uprising of violence\\nwithin his State, or a prison\\nbreak or a disaster which\\nmight occur while Missis\\nsippi’s National Guard was\\nunder Federal control? Presi\\ndent Eisenhower was also\\nguilty of the same breach of\\nthe Constitution when he\\nsimilarly acted at Little Rock,.\\nArkansas.\\nHad the case been tried\\nbefore the Supreme Court\\nand a verdict rendered in\\nfavor of Meredith, and had\\nthe State of Mississippi then\\nrefused to abide by the de\\ncision, I would agree that the\\nPresident should use force as\\nhe has done, in enforcing the\\nlaw. But this is not the way\\nit happened. Consequently,\\nthe President has violated the\\nConstitution in at least two\\nrespects using force in\\nlieu of the lawful consider\\nation of the case by the\\nSupreme Court and feder\\nalizing the State militia with\\nout authority that is valid.\\nWilliam O.

He said. “That’s an\\nother matter.” I asked him\\nif they had ever been able\\nto produce a new species by\\ncross-breeding (for instance,\\ngetting the mule to creed).\\nHe said they had not, “but\\nalmost.” Neither mutations\\nnor cross-breeding ever pro\\nduce a new species!

NOYES\\nForeign Corre.pondent of The Star ,\\nKennedy-Khrushchev Talk Likely\\nPARIS\\nThe one thing on which\\nnearly everybody now seems\\nagreed is that an early meet\\ning between President Ken\\nnedy and Premier Khru\\nshchev is highly probable.\\n-If Mr. Kennedy is not in\\nterested in coming to Mos\\ncow, Mr. Khrushchev, it is\\nfelt, will come to New York\\nfor the General Assembly\\nsession of the United Na\\ntions. And if he comes, Mr.\\nKennedy has already indi\\ncated that he would ask him\\nto stop by, providing, of\\ncourse, that nothing unpleas\\nant has happened in Berlin\\nin the meantime.\\nApart from the impression\\nthat Mr. Khrushchev is anx\\nious for such a meeting,\\nhowever, conflicting ideas\\nabout its usefulness, its dan\\ngers and its probable results\\nare as thick as the autumn\\nleaves. As is usually the case\\nwhere the motives of the\\nRussian Premier are in\\nvolved, Western opinion is\\ndivided between those who\\nhope there is nothing to be\\nlost and those who fear there\\nis nothing to be gained.\\nThe argument, at least,\\nhas advanced a stage from\\nthe rather sterile bickering\\nbetween the \"hard line”\\nAllies who oppose any dis\\ncussion of the Berlin prob\\nlem and the \"flexible” school\\nwhich feels that negotiation\\nis at all times preferable to\\nwar. A curious fact is that\\nsome of the most rigid of\\nhardliners are the most opti\\nmistic about the possibilities\\nof a Khrushchev - Kennedy\\nmeeting at this stage.\\nPessimists vs. Optimists\\nThe pessimists today are\\nthose who believe that Mr.\\nKhrushchev has been mis\\nled by American efforts to\\nkeep open the lines of East-\\nWest communication on Ber\\nlin. If Premier Khrushchev\\nshould come to Washington\\nunder the false impression\\nthat he can wring important\\nconcessions from the Presi\\ndent, the results of the meet\\ning might, indeed, be even\\nworse than those of their\\nfirst encounter in Vienna last\\nyear.\\nA number of arguments are\\nheard in these parts, how\\never, that this may not be the\\ncase. The moi‘e optimistic\\nline of speculation holds that\\nMr. Khrushchev is once again\\nanxious to forestall a crisis\\non Berlin rather than precip\\nitate one.\\nThe timetable ascribed to\\nthe Russian Premier by the\\nprophets in Washington is\\nquestioned by some experts\\nhere. According to this time-\\nA BOOK FOR TODAY\\nBy DONALD MINTZ\\nTheories About Our Ancient Redmen\\nLOST TRIBES & SUNKEN\\nCONTINENTS, Myth and\\nMethod in the Study of\\nthe American Indians. By\\nRobert Wauchope.,lss pp.,\\nillus. (University of Chi\\ncago Press: $3.95.)\\nWorkers in most areas of\\nscience and scholarship \\'can\\ngo their way unimpeded by\\nfervent and misguided lay\\nmen who plant themselves in\\nthe middle of the path and\\n|ell the professionals that\\nthey are nothing but vicious,\\nigrtorant fools while simulta\\nneously appealing for profes\\nsional sanction of favorite,\\npersonal theories. But an in\\ncautious astronomer may find\\nhimself listening to an ex\\nposition of a strange theory\\nof the origin of the solar\\nsystem, and imprudent an\\nthropologists and archeolo\\ngists are forever being told\\nabout lost tribes and sunken\\ncontinents.\\nRobert Wauchope, director\\nof the Middle American Re\\nsearch Institute and professor\\nof anthropology at Tulane\\nUniversity, is deliberately im\\nprudent because \"one won\\nders what theories are these\\nthat so capture imagination\\nand fierce allegiance, and\\nwhat sort of men are so ob\\nsessed with mystic and re\\nligious interpretation of the\\nancient American past that\\nthey will follow them, some\\ntimes literally, to the death\\nagainst all opposition.”\\n“Lost Tribes St Sunken\\nContinents” results not from\\n\"one’s” wonder but from Prof.\\nWauchope’s. The little book\\nundertakes to examine the\\nnature of these various un\\nacceptable \"interpretations of\\nthe ancient American past\"\\nand to tell the reader some\\nthing of the men who have\\ncontrived and defended them.\\nBOTH THEORIES and men\\nare numerous. “Perhaps the\\nmost popular theory about\\nAmerican Indian origins de\\nrives the famous ancient\\ncivilizations of Mexico, Cen\\ntral America, and the Andes\\nfrom Egypt.” Then there are\\nthose, and they are “the\\ntruly enthusiastic non-profes\\nsionals,” who look elsewhere\\nfor these mysterious origins:\\nPrimarily to \"Lost Atlantis\"\\nor “The Lost Tribes of Israel.\" •\\nThen there is the Kublai\\nKhan theory which holds that\\nthe culture of the American ,\\nIndians was derived from\\nChina in the 13th century\\nA. D. And there is a variant\\nof this, the \"Men Out of\\nAsia” idea, that holds “that\\nafter the death of Alexander\\nthe Great in 323 B C., some\\nsurvivors of his wrecked fleet\\nunder Admiral Nearchus\\nsailed* eastward, picking up\\nartisans in India and South\\neastern Asia, and made an\\nepic voyage across the Pacific,\\nwhere they and their descen\\ndants were responsible for the\\ntable, Mr. Khrushchev will\\nmove quickly after the Amer\\nican congressional elections\\non November 6 to sign his\\nlong-threatened separate\\npeace treaty with East Ger\\nmany and then will come to\\nNew York to defend his ac\\ntion in the General Assembly.\\nA meeting with the Presi\\ndent under these circum\\nstances would hardly seem\\nauspicious.\\nSome European experts be\\nlieve that the order of things\\nwill be reversed. Mr. Khru\\nshchev in the past four years,\\nhas made full use of the\\npeace treaty threat as a dip\\nlomatic lever. It is believed\\nhe will not sign away this\\nuseful leverage without at\\nleast one more attempt to\\nreopen a top-level discus\\nsion of the whole Berlin prob\\nlem.\\nTreaty Signing Later\\nIt is believed therefore,\\nthat any trip to New York\\nwould take place before the\\nsigning of a separate peace\\ntreaty with East Germany.\\nIts purpose would not be to\\njustify an action but to rally\\nsupport for attendance at a\\npeace conference among the\\nneutralist nations. The Rus\\nsians, it is felt here, have al\\nways looked forward to mak\\ning the peace conference as\\nimpressive an affair as pos\\nsible—and one which might\\nlast for weeks or even\\nmonths.\\nSimilarly, any meeting with\\nPresident Kennedy would be\\nmore a search for alterna\\ntives than ap effort to con\\nfront the President with a\\nfait accompli. The impression\\nremains that Mr. Khru\\nshchev is not really anxious\\nto carry out,his threat and\\nwould cheerfully seize on any\\nreasonable pretext for post\\nponing the action once again.\\nSuch a pretext might be\\nfound, perhaps, in a Western\\nproposal for an international\\nauthority to control access\\nto Berlin, talk of which has\\nbeen revived in recent days.\\nProlonged negotiation on\\nsuch a crucial question could\\nprovide justification for a\\nnew delay with Mr. Khru\\nshchev\\'s own militant critics\\nat home.\\nIt is perfectly possible, of\\ncourse, that this relatively\\noptimistic speculation is\\nwrong and that Mr. Khru\\nshchev’s timetable allows for\\nno such flexibility. On the\\npresent evidence, however, it\\nis hard to agree with those\\nwho argue that any meeting\\nwould do more harm than\\ngood and that the door of\\nthe White House should at\\nall cost remain firmly barred.\\npre-Columbian nign civiliza\\ntions of the Maya region and\\nthe Peruvian Andes.”\\nBut this Is not all. There\\nis the “Kon-Tiki” Idea which\\nis more or less the reverse.\\nIt holds that \"Polynesian\\npopulations and culture were\\n. . . derived from South\\nAmerica, carried about A. D.\\n500 by the legendary Peru\\nvian culture-hero, the blond\\ngod Viracocha and his fellow\\nmigrants.\"\\nThe holders of these views\\nare often guilty of an at\\ntitude that puzzles the sci\\nentist. He cannot reconcile\\n\"their proud avowal on the\\none hand that they are not\\nbound by the scientists’ rules\\nof empirical research and\\nare quite willing to use in*\\ntuition or supernaturally de\\nrived evidence in their ‘re\\nsearch’” with their contin\\nued protests \"that they are\\nas scientific as anyone else\\nin their methods.”\\nPROF, WAUCHOPE cannot\\nhope to refute this rich col\\nlection of assorted theories.\\nFor his book is brief and it\\nis in the nature of science\\nthat its rebuttal of pseudo\\nscience is as complex as the\\npseudo-science itself is sim\\nple. But Carlton Cooley’s dis\\ncussion of some of these\\nmatters in an elementary\\ntextbook shows that it is pos\\nsible to do far more than\\nhas Prof. Wauchope.\\nThen, too, we are told al\\nmost nothing about the psy\\nchological motivation of the\\nholders of \"wild theories” ‘\\nand literally nothing about\\nthe sociology of organized\\ngroups of believers.\\nProf. Wauchope never calls\\nthese people a name as bad\\nas \"crackpots.” Frequently,\\nhe calls them \"mystics.” In\\nthe last chapter, he men\\ntions Martin Gardner\\'s term,\\n\"crank pseudo-scientists,”\\nand Indirectly suggests that\\nthose he has been discussing\\nare fully qualified for that\\nname.

HADLEY\\n■tar Financial Editor\\nWashington Oas Light Co. is\\nconsidering moving its *4O mil\\nlion project for underground\\nstorage of natural gas from\\nPrince Georges County, Md., to\\nanother State, probably Vir\\nginia\\n“The company now is rapidly\\nreviewing an alternate plan for\\nstoring gas underground in an\\nother State,” Donald S. Bittin\\nger. president, told stockhold\\ners at the annual meeting yes\\nterday.\\nSigns pointed to Virginia as\\nan alternative site. The com\\npany has developed the Ra\\nvensworth propane storage cav\\nern in Fairfax County. Vs. Ar\\nrangements for this *5 million\\nproject were made in less than\\n90 days. When it is completed,\\nlater this year, the county will\\nderive substantial additional\\ntaxes, a company spokesman\\nsaid today.\\nA bill empowering the com\\npany to acquire additional\\nunderground rights for its\\nBrandywine storage project in\\nPrince Georges County passed\\na second reading in the Mary\\nland House of Delegates yes\\nterday. However, two amend\\nments attached to ,lt were de\\nscribed by company officials\\nas raising Insurmountable bar\\nriers to the continuation of the\\nproject.\\nProvides Special Tax\\nOne would provide for a spe\\ncial county tax of IS per cent\\non the commodity cost value\\nof all gas stored in the project\\nat the end of each calendar\\nyear. This special levy would\\nbe in addition to all normal\\ntaxes on the investment.\\nA second amendment would\\nmake the company liable for\\ndamages on a very broad scale.\\nCompany officials said Wash\\nington Gas would expect to\\nbear normal liabilities in con\\nnection with the project, but\\npointed out the amendment\\nprovides that it would be liable\\nfor damages without regard to\\nnegligence within an area of\\n10 miles of the stored gas or\\nplace of injection on the basis\\nof prime facie evidence.\\nMr. Bittinger told stockhold\\ners the added 15 per cent tax\\ncould make it Impossible to\\ncontinue the project. Another\\ncompany official said today\\nthe extended liability amend\\nment probably would be just\\nas much of a factor standing\\nin the way of continuation.\\n“At a time when States end\\ncounties all over the Nation\\nare offering competitive attrac\\ntions, often in the form of tax\\nconcessions to encourage desir\\nable development, Prince\\nGeorges County appears to be\\nmoving in the opposite direc\\ntion by proposing additional\\nburdensome taxation on the\\nBrandywine project,” declared\\nMr. Bittinger.\\n*3 Million Invested\\nTo date, Washington Gas has\\nInvested around *3 million in\\nthe Brandywine project. This\\nincludes the cost of well sites\\nand a compressor site, but the\\nlargest proportion represents\\nexpenses of geological explora\\ntion and engineering costs, it is\\nunderstood.\\nThe company\\'s legal staff\\nand engineers are hard at work\\nstudying plans for alternatives\\nin another State and when\\ntheir studies are completed, re\\nsults will be submitted for. ac\\ntion to top executives and then\\nto the board of directors.

P. news dispatches.\\nB-4\\nHome Rule Hitch\\nThe Star’s opposition in the past to\\nmost “home rule” bills for the District\\nhas sprung from a real concern that\\ntheir enactment would serve to discour\\nage, rather than encourage, the payment\\nof an equitable share of the expenses of\\nthe city by the Federal Government.\\nNow the President once again has sent\\nCongress a home rule bill which, if\\nadopted as proposed, would seem to\\nmeet that objection.\\nThis latest bill, which differs only\\nslightly from the administration version\\nproposed a year ago, contains a specific\\nand generally fair formula for measur\\ning the size of the annual Federal pay\\nment. The essential feature of the for\\nmula, however, as far as home rule Is\\nconcerned, provides that these funds,\\nmathematically determined each year\\nby the formula, would be advanced auto\\nmatically to the District of Columbia\\nfrom the United States Treasury, with\\nout further action by Congress. If Con\\ngress will commit itself to meet Its fiscal\\nobligation to the District through this\\nor some other equally acceptable pro\\nvision as a part of the home rule bill,\\nwe would support the measure. Without\\nthe Inclusion—and final enactment—of\\nsuch a binding commitment, however, we\\nwould persist in our opposition to home\\nrule.\\nCongress has defaulted year after\\nyear on the insufficient Federal payment\\namounts which It has authorized by law.\\nAnd It makes even these inadequate\\nfunds available only after the desperate\\nurgency of the need has been painfully\\nproved and proved again during com\\nmittee hearings and congressional de\\nbate In connection with the annual Dis\\ntrict budget.\\nOur basic concern about any new\\nhome rule bill Is that Congress will not\\npermit the District authorities to make\\ntheir own budgetary decisions and\\nthen support them to the extent of the\\nFederal fiscal assistance which would\\nresult from application of the proposed\\nformula. Without this commitment and\\nthis support, home rule could be more\\nthan a snare and a delusion. It could\\nbe a disaster for this city.\\nViewing America\\'s Future\\nIn the minds of most Americans of\\nmiddle age or beyond, the year 2000\\nseems a bit too remote to warrant great\\nconcern about how the Nation’s supply\\nof land and other natural resources will\\nserve the needs of that year’s population.\\nBut If this casual attitude Is justified\\nfor some of the older folks, It cannot\\nbe so for those who have every reason\\nto expect to be toasting the arrival of a\\nnew century less than 37 years hence.\\nThis Is, in fact, not very far away, and\\nIt Is by no means too soon to give thought\\nto the living problems of that day.\\nResources for the Future, Inc., a\\nnonprofit research corporation financed\\nby the Ford Foundation, has now re\\nleased the findings of a five-year study\\nIn depth of this matter, with the en\\ncouraging conclusion that no “general\\nrunning out of resources” in this country\\nis likely during the remainder of this\\ncentury or even for a long time there\\nafter. At the same time, the research\\ngroup qualified this conclusion In sev\\neral Important respects—warning that\\nsevere temporary and regional shortages\\nof some resource products may develop.\\nUsing the Census Bureau population\\nprojection of 331 million by year 2000,\\nthe researchers speak confidently of the\\nability of available cropland to produce\\nall the food and fibers needed during the\\nnext 40 years. Even so, they add, cumu\\nlative demands for land—for expanding\\ncities, highways, airfields, reservoirs, wa\\ntersheds, recreation space and so forth—\\nwill be so great as to create a \"land def\\nicit” by the turn of the century. In this\\ncase, they suggest “multiple use\" as one\\nsolution.\\nWhile seeing no prospect of water\\nshortage on a nationwide scale, the study\\ndid pose some problems of a regional\\nnature. In the East, for example, there\\nIs no concern about quantity but very\\nreal concern about pollution. Increased\\nstorage capacity and more effective\\ntreatment of wastes are two of the rec\\nommended efforts. The West, with a\\nmuch smaller normal supply, will need\\nnot only new dams, reservoirs, long-dis\\ntance water transport systems, desalinl\\nzatlon and conservation programs, but\\nalso what the research group calls a\\nSUNDAY, APRIL 7, ISS3\\nbetter allocation of water resources\\namong competing uses.\\nIt Is not news, of course, that prob\\nlems of this nature He ahead, and It Is\\nnot easy to say who should do what to\\ncope with them. All levels of govern\\nment—Federal, State and local—have a\\nshare of responsibility. So, too, does pri\\nvate enterprise—both In utilization of\\nnatural resources and in a search for\\nsuitable substitutes. The effort by all\\nparties must be co-operative and con\\ntinuing. The Ford group has been help\\nful In putting together a comprehensive\\ndiscussion of things as they may be\\nwhen the 21st century arrives.\\n\\'... That Ye Be Not Judged’\\nVery few people will doubt that Dr.\\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer fully merits the\\nhighly prized Fermi Award for 1963 and\\nthe $50,000 in cash that goes with It.\\nFor he as much as any other man, and\\nperhaps more than any other man, was\\nresponsible for the great achievement\\nwhich produced the atomic bomb, and\\nwhich, In turn, pointed the way to peace\\nful uses of the atom.\\nOne must look with some reserva\\ntion, however, on Intimations In the news\\nreports that the winning of the Fermi\\nAward will serve to “clear” Dr. Oppen\\nheimer of the findings which, almost a\\ndecade ago, led to his exclusion from ac\\ncess to classified Information on the\\nground that he was a security risk.\\nWe are mindful of Matthew’s ad\\nmonition on the hazard of judging, and\\nwe certainly would not presume to pass\\njudgment on Dr. Oppenheimer. But\\nneither are we prepared to say that the\\ndecision of the conscientious men who\\nheard the testimony pro and con In\\nthe Oppenheimer case and who weighed\\nthe transcript of that testimony—nearly\\n1,000 pages—can be reversed merely by\\nthe presentation of the Fermi or any\\nother award. Os eight men who heard\\nthe case, six, in varying degrees, were\\npersuaded against Dr. Oppenheimer.\\nAll of this, however, occurred nearly\\na decade ago. And It is possible that\\nnew judges (we do not know of any new\\nevidence) might now decide differently\\non the old record. But of Itself the\\nFermi Award, although richly deserved,\\nclears nobody and changes nothing.\\nIn 1954, while the Atomic Energy\\nCommission was debating its finding, Dr.\\nOppenheimer published a little book In\\nwhich he discussed something he de\\nscribed as “the house called science.”\\nOs It, he said: “It Is a vast house Indeed\\n. . . there are no locks, there are no shut\\ndoors; wherever we go there are the\\nsigns and usually the words of welcome.\\nIt Is an open house, open to all comers.”\\nThis may be of some reassurance, If\\nDr. Oppenheimer’s access to classified\\ninformation should be restored, to those\\nwho go to bed at night and who wake up\\nIn the morning worrying about spies.\\nThe findings against Dr. Oppenheimer\\ndid not bring his loyalty Into question.\\nBut the Russians, with their achieve\\nments in space, have shown that the\\nhouse of science of which he wrote Is\\nIndeed open to all.\\nFirst Responsibility\\nAt a meeting of the Central Labor\\nUnion Council the other night, it was\\nsuggested that opposition of some Dis\\ntrict School Board members to lifting\\nthe ban on corporal punishment may\\nstem from a fear of providing new\\nammunition to anti-lntegrationists in\\nthe South. In reply, School Superintend\\nent Hansen had this to say:\\nI understand what you mean. No matter\\nwhat happens in a newly integrated area,\\nthose who are opposed to integration will say,\\n‘‘Now look at what It has caused.” So we\\nhave to be careful not to Interject the ques\\ntion of race. . . . But we have a responsibility\\nto educate children who come Into our class\\nrooms as well as we possibly can. In order to\\ndo this more satisfactorily than we have been\\ndoing, we need to give teachers additional\\nauthority. This is what the teachers tell us\\nthemselves. What we are attempting to do\\nis to make our recently Integrated school\\nsystem the best possible demonstration of\\nintegration.\\nWhat a sensible answer! And how\\nrefreshing It Is to hear this subject\\nfinally discussed forthrightly. For the\\nfact which has emerged most clearly\\nfrom the shocking allegations of the\\nMacCarthy Committee report, and from\\nall that has occurred since, is a recogni\\ntion that harmful and dangerous condi\\ntions In our schools already have been\\ncovered up for too long, and that, smol\\ndering under cover, they have grown\\nsteadily worse.\\nNo doubt the Inadequacies recently\\nrevealed, especially relating to discipli\\nnary problems, will be seized upon by\\nthose who are out to discredit Integra\\ntion. And It Is quite likely that a major\\nreason for avoiding public discussion of\\nthese conditions in the past was a desire\\nto put the brightest possible face on the\\nIntegration experience In Washington.\\nBut surely those people who have been\\nso mesmerized by this concern that they\\nhave closed their eyes to everything else\\nmust realize, If they think about It, that\\na continuation of this kind of blindness\\nnow cannot serve the cause of Integra\\ntion and will merely tend to destroy\\npublic education In Washington.\\n4 Better Minuteman\\nA few years ago there was something\\ncalled “the missile gap” (a fiction exist\\ning only in politicians’ minds), and now\\nwe have what Is called the “Improved\\nMinuteman.” Even In Its original form,\\nthis solid-fuel Intercontinental ballistic\\nmissile was a formidable thing to think\\nabout, but today It Is In the process of\\nbeing developed into a weapon so deadly\\n(four times as effective as Its current\\nmodel) that a layman’s mind can hardly\\ncomprehend the speed and magnitude\\nof its destructiveness. What can be com\\nprehended, however, is that the field of\\nrocketry is subject to constant change\\nand advancement. This Includes such\\nconceivable break-throughs as a work\\nable antimissile missile. The “Improved\\nMinuteman\" is a case in point.\\nMy\\n1 HfOWrw I\\nrn X W?V7 7 JU J\\n. —ll-^....... iiiiT——-—-- ’\\nPlenty of Near Misses—But No Bull\\'s-Eye\\nLETTERS TO THE STAR\\nRight to Arm\\nGreat concern is being ex\\npressed today about “civil\\nrights.” And rightly so. The\\nonly way any of us can hope\\nto preserve our rights as free\\ncitizens of a free republic is\\nto be ready and willing to de\\nfend them at all times against\\nthose who would take them\\nfrom us—on the battlefield,\\nto protect them from armed\\naggression, or through the\\ndemocratic process, to pro\\ntect them from our own fel\\nlow citizens who would seek,\\nundoubtedly from sincere\\nmotives, to weaken or destroy\\nthem for the sake of admin\\nistrative convenience.\\nThis is very much the case\\nin the current controversy\\nover firearms legislation.\\nArticle II of the Bill of\\nRights was placed there be\\ncause Its framers realized\\nwhat some of us tend, these\\ndays, to forget; that one of\\nthe most precious rights of a\\nfree citizen is his right to arm\\nhimself for lawful recreation,\\nfor his own protection and\\nthat of his family, and for\\nthe defense of his home in\\ntime of war or emergency.\\nThis, like freedom of speech\\nand religion, like the right of\\npeaceful assembly, or like the\\nright of freedom from unrea\\nsonable search and seizure, is\\none of the hallmarks of the\\nfree man as contrasted with\\nthe subject, who has no rights\\nbut only privileges, granted\\nby the State and which the\\nState may limit or take away\\nat its own good pleasure.\\nIf we, as the result of a\\nwave of artificially generated\\nhysteria, permit our consti\\ntutional right to “keep and\\nbear arms” to be restricted\\nor revoked, do we not thus\\ncreate a most dangerous prec\\nedent? If it is perfectly all\\nright to demolish the Second\\nAmendment because certain\\nlaw-enforcement officials feel\\nit would be to their conven\\nience, can this not be done\\nfor the same sort of “reason”\\nto any of our other rights?\\nWhy not. for instance, put a\\ncurb on the powerful weapon\\nof a free press by requiring\\nnewspapers and magazines to\\npossess licenses to publish?\\nThe press, like anything else.\\nIs susceptible, no doubt, to\\nabuses. But we don’t try to\\ncorrect these abuses by sum\\nmarily punishing the Inno\\ncent. And we don’t look to\\narbitrary bureaucratic meas\\nures to remedy the situation.\\nMost Important of all, we real\\nize that the press is so vital\\nto our free society that its\\nunlicensed, “unregulated” ex\\nistence is far preferable to\\nany small and questionable\\n“good” that might be accom\\nplished by putting it under\\npolitical control.\\nIf one of our constitutional\\nrights can be abridged or de\\nstroyed at will, then we can\\nrest assured that, sooner or\\nlater, so will the rest of them.\\nJohn C.

Rab\\nbits aren’t either, for that\\nmatter. The mirtiandllng of\\nthese live “toys” by small\\nchildren leads only to the\\nanimals having broken bones\\nand a sad death after break\\ning the child’s heart—a most\\nunfortunate memory of a\\nvery unhappy Easter.\\nIf you want to give your\\nchild an Easter pet. please\\nhave someone or someplace\\nthat will accept the pet when\\nMomma tires of caring for\\nit and be sure thnt the child\\nis old enough to handle the\\ncreature with care, Thus\\nmuch sadness and pain can\\nbe avoided.\\nEthel Quillian Bixby.\\nPen names may be used if\\nletters carry writers’ correct\\nnames and addresses.

Law\\nrence tacitly admits this in\\nignoring the very point he\\nraised.\\nMr. Lawrence ends his\\nApril 1 article with one of\\nhis favorites (as he admits,\\nthis Is the same material he\\nused for the Little Rock epi\\nsode). He criticizes the “po\\nlice state” justification of\\naction, that the “end justi\\nfies the means.” I never have\\nbeen able to understand that\\none.

Food was be\\ncoming alarmingly scarce in\\nseme sections of the Con\\nfederacy. A bread riot oc\\ncurred in Richmond about\\nthis time a century ago and\\non April 10. 1863, Jefferson\\nDavis issued a proclamation\\nurging his people to plant\\ncorn, beans, peas and other\\nnecessities. Instead of cot\\nton and tobacco. The Star\\nof April 9, 1863, quoted from\\nRichmond newspapers the\\nprices residents of Dixie’s\\ncapital had to pay to exist:\\nApples, 850 a barrel; butter,\\n83 a pound; bacon. 81.40 a\\npound; hams, 81.45 a pound;\\nbrandy, 823 a gallon; com,\\n87.50 a bushel; meal, 88 and\\n810 a bushel; coffee, 84 and\\n84.50 a pound; flour, 831 to\\n836 a barrel; sugar 81.20 to\\n81.30 a pound. The same\\nstory said: \"The Sentinel\\neditorially refers In ambi\\nguous terms to a riot which\\ntook place In Richmond of\\nsuch magnitude as to cause\\nthe affair to be suppressed\\nfrom publication. It appears\\nthat the city was for a while\\nin control of a lawless mob\\nof women and men for the\\nostensible purpose to save\\nthemselves from starvation\\nby breaking open stores, bak\\neries, etc. The movement was\\nheaded by a female, who,\\nthe Sentinel says, was above\\nwant, and the whole affair\\nwas simply to rob and plun\\nder, under the excuse of\\nscarcity of food. Millinery,\\ndry goods and fancy stores\\nsuffered as much as those\\ncontaining the necessities of\\nlife. The movement appears\\nto have eventuated from\\nhigh prices generally. . . .\"\\nIn another column the same\\nday, this paper elaborated:\\nSPIRES OF THE SPIRIT\\nA Spire Above an Inn\\nBy DR. FREDERICK BROWN HARRIS\\nChaplain of lhe United State* Senate\\nA spire usually marks a\\nplace dedicated to worship of\\nGod and service to man. It\\nis a symbol of reverence and\\nof spiritual verities which\\npoint skyward from the dust\\nof earth. The spires of Oxford\\nsuggest that schools where\\ntruth is sought and taught\\ncan also be fittingly so\\nadorned.\\nNow, ordinarily one does\\nnot picture a spire rising\\nabove an inn. But recently at\\na gathering of servants of\\nsuffering humanity at the In\\nternational Inn in the Na\\ntion’s Capital, for those with\\neyes to see there arose a\\nspire as high as the Washing\\nton Monument. That invisi\\nble spire is the emblem of\\nthe best in the life of our\\nAmerica. In these hectic days\\nwe have come to an almost\\npathological emphasis on the\\nworst that can be catalogued\\nin the Nation’s record. With\\nour own acknowledgment of\\nthe sorry story of rising\\ncrime and delinquency, of\\nbusiness chicanery,, hypoc\\nrisy, and deceptive manip\\nulation for selfish ends in\\nall walks of life, many are\\ntempted to put on sackcloth\\nand ashes and label our so\\ncalled civilization as hope\\nlessly corrupt. But based on\\nthe dirty linen on the na\\ntional clothesline such a\\nverdict loses sight of the pre\\nponderant proportion of\\ngoodness in the Republic\\nthat leavens the blasphem\\ning wickedness. It closes its\\neyes to the examples of self\\nless service to human need\\neverywhere that make Amer\\nica the most inspiring res\\nervoir of sacrificial goodwill\\nin all the earth. When we\\nsense the beneficent impact\\nof the United States on the\\nrest of the world, what we\\nsee calls not for jeers but\\nfor cheers!\\nThe meeting place for an\\norganization of mobilized\\ncompassion, which adds\\ntremendously to that impact,\\nwas appropriately Interna\\ntional Inn. There it was that\\nthose who came from far and\\nnear heard with joyful grati\\ntude almost unbelievable re\\nports packed with notable\\nexploits of MEDICO-CARE\\nwhich is but another name\\nfor America’s outreach for\\nthe alleviation of misery any\\nwhere in the world which is\\none.\\nIt was in 1958 that MED\\nICO had breathed upon it\\nthe breath of life by Dr.\\nPeter D. Comanduras who\\nwas present and presiding at\\nthis gathering and by the\\nlate heroic Dr. Thomas A.\\nDooley of Laos hospital\\nfame. Its scope is measured\\nby the appellation “nonsec\\ntarian” its uncalculating\\nself-denial by the term “non\\nprofit.” As across the years\\nMEDICO has gone forth with\\ndoctors, nurses and hospi\\ntals performing miracles of\\nhealing, teaching and train\\ning.

We wish the President every suc\\ncess, and we hope that some good results\\nwill come out of this undertaking, as\\nwell as other efforts which he has been\\nmaking.\\nOs more Immediate interest, how\\never, is a news report from our reporter,\\nLee Cohn, to the effect that the national\\nconstruction unions are putting the heat\\non their locals, particularly in Washing\\nton, to cease and desist from practices\\nwhich for many years have barred quali\\nfied Negroes from jobs on local building\\nprojects.\\nThe practical result of this national\\nunion proposal, as we understand it, is\\nto make the contractor responsible for\\ndeciding whether an applicant for a job,\\nwhite or colored, has the requisite quali\\nfications. If the contractor decides that\\na Negro is qualified, he will hire him.\\nAnd the local union, under the national\\nunion edict, must accept the Negro for\\nmembership in the local.\\nIt is not our purpose to suggest that\\nthis, alone, will solve the problem of\\ndiscrimination. But it is a big, and\\nmaybe a giant, step forward.

But now they\\nhave worked out with Malaya, the fed\\neration’s heart, a “complete agreement\\non how to resolve problems of common\\nconcern arising out of the proposal to\\nestablish” the new nation in the weeks\\nimmediately ahead.\\nThis is encouraging news. What it\\nmeans, if words may be taken at face\\nvalue, is that the federation will be al\\nlowed to come into being without any\\nviolent counteraction, verbal or other\\nwise, by the Indonesians or the Filipinos\\nas regards certain territorial claims they\\nhave in Malaysia. Instead, the* claims\\nwill be submitted to a kind of interna\\ntional arbitration board, whose findings\\nall parties concerned have apparently\\nagreed to accept.\\nEven more significant, however, is\\nthe fact that the accord reached by the\\nthree countries at their ministerial\\nmeeting in Manila includes provisions\\naimed at working out a pact of mutual\\ndefense against “subversion in any form\\nor manifestation.” Indonesia, the Phil\\nippines and Malaya—especially the lat\\nter—have very large numbers of Chinese\\nin their population, and they are wor\\nried about how Communist China, which\\nseems eager to gobble up everything in\\nthat part of the world, might be able to\\nuse these people to promote its expan\\nsionist ambitions. Hence, in effect, the\\nManila agreement on this matter\\namounts to a sort of alliance against\\nPeking.\\nAll this Is particularly noteworthy\\nwhen one recalls that Indonesia\\'s Presi-\\nMONDAY, JUNE 17, 1963\\ndent Sukarno, who recently played host\\nto Red China’s chief of state, has long\\nbeen acting the role of a “neutralist”\\nin the cold war. In the process—up to\\nnow, that Is—he has given every indica\\ntion of being more pro-Communlst than\\npro-West. But today, even though it\\nmay be a mirage, everything looks re\\nmarkably different.\\nMaybe Red China’s attack on India\\naccounts for the phenomenon. In any\\ncase, whatever the reason, “neutralist\"\\nDr. Sukarno now has seen fit to align\\nhimself with the altogether anti-Com\\nmunlst and pro-Western Malayan and\\nFilipino republics. Change is a funda\\nmental law of life, and in this Instance\\nit certainly seems all to the good.\\nArs Gratis\\nWe welcome the President’s creation\\nof an Advisory Council on the Arts. Car\\nrying on the work begun by August\\nHeckscher as White House consultant on\\nthe arts, the council, composed of the\\n.heads of relevant departments and 30\\nart-involved citizens, may be expected\\nto produce about 40 times as many lec\\ntures on art as Mr. Heckscher did. The\\nover-all quality of the rhetoric will prob\\nably not be as high as his, but certainly\\nmore listeners can be reached. ,\\nWill the council do anything else?\\nIt seems unlikely. For the hard fact is\\nthat for Government to discharge its\\nresponsibilities to the arts, It has to\\nspend money on them. While every ma\\njor and middle-sized country in the\\nworld does that, no American admin\\nistration in over 20 years has been will\\ning to do so. The New Frontier’s cele\\nbrated concern for the arts has so far\\nbeen limited to expressions of esteem\\nand to upgrading the after-dinner enter\\ntainment at the White House.\\nIf anyone connected with the new\\nenterprise is really serious about it, there\\nis one obvious place to begin. The\\nservices and the space agency all have\\nart programs based on conning artists\\ninto working without pay. This deplor\\nable practice should be reformed at once.\\nIt may be true that America is not yet\\nready to join the rest of civilization in\\npublic support for art, but a giant step\\nforward would be to stop Government\\nfree-loading on artists.\\nDowntown Renewal\\nA year ago the urgently needed Dis\\ntrict legislation to authorize the use of\\nurban renewal powers in commercial\\nareas passed the House in a breeze and\\nfell apart in the Senate District Com\\nmittee. Now the Senate committee has\\nvigorously Indorsed the measure and the\\ngreatest hurdle to its enactment appears\\nironically to be in the House.\\nThe reason for this doubt lies en\\ntirely In the fact that the House District\\nCommittee is currently conducting a\\nlengthy and somewhat disconnected in\\nquiry into virtually every aspect of the\\nWashington renewal program, with em\\nphasis on specific projects proposed or\\nunder way. This inquiry, however,\\nshould not be allowed to interfere with\\nthe simple clarification of law embodied\\nin the Senate bill. This legislation is\\nthe key to our “Downtown Progress”\\nplan. It is vital to Washington. It\\nalready has been carefully considered\\nby the House committee. And it would\\ndo no more than give to the District\\nthe same right which nearly every other\\nmajor American city already possesses\\nto utilize urban renewal as one of the\\nnecessary tools to revitalize its old and\\ndeteriorating commercial areas.\\nCheers, Mr. Schriner\\nHere’s a name to remember: A.

The\\nemphasis was almost exclu\\nsively on this life, further\\nmore. Even Plato, strongly\\ninfluenced as he was by Py\\nthagoreanism and perhaps by\\nthe religious movement\\nknown as Orphism, obsessed\\nas he was with the soul.\\nIn his practical ethics was\\nfundamentally earthbound.”\\nOr this on the origin of\\nGreek science: \"WhatJs the\\nworld? What is man? These\\nwere not new questions. But\\npreviously the answers were\\nmythical; they were stories,\\noften with a genealogical\\nquality or flavour. Earth\\ngave birth to the sky. Zeus,\\nPoseidon and Hades were\\nthree brothers who over\\nthrew the Titans and divided\\nthe universe among them\\nselves Into three realms.\\nMan was created. Such\\nmythical answers are world\\nwide In one form or another,\\nand their quality as explana\\ntion is always essentially\\nthe same. Myth is specific\\nand concrete, explaining\\nboth natural and human\\nphenomena by reference to\\nparticular supernatural\\nevents or actions, in them\\nselves unaccountable. The\\nlonian revolution was sim\\nply this, that Thales and his\\nsuccessors asked generalized\\nquestions and proposed gen\\neral, rational, ‘lmpersonal’\\nanswers. To be sure, they be\\ngan by naive speculation, and\\nsuch suggestions as ’The\\nearth stays in place through\\nfloating like a log* do not\\nget us very far.

To attempt in effect\\nto reverse it now would be\\nmadness. Nobody knows this\\nbetter than, for example, the\\nIsraelis—who have, Heaven\\nknows, quite enough reason\\nto remember the old Ger\\nmany.\\nThe bottom truth is that\\nthose who . are so full of\\n“protests” at this Presidential\\nvisit to our Western Allies\\nwould be caroling joyfully\\nabout if the President were\\ngoing hat in hand, say, to\\nneutralist India or, better\\nyet, to some pompous con\\nclave of “African leaders” in\\nsome dreary place like Ghana.\\n(Copyrisht, 1953)\\nfort itself, or the significance\\nfor the future of intellectual\\nendeavour.\"\\nThese two long quotations\\nare offered byway of demon\\nstrating the extraordinary\\nnature of this little book. Dr.\\nFinley, an American-born\\nfellow of Jesus College, Cam\\nbridge, has not tried to write\\na history of Greece in 177\\npages. The result would have\\nbeen an excruciating proces\\nlon of unintegrated facts.\\nNor, on the other hand,\\nhas he produced a souffle of\\nunsupported conclusions. He\\nhas tried, he says, \"to ex\\nplain how Greek civilization\\ndeveloped in its various as\\npects, its strengths and\\nweaknesses, materially, so\\ncially, politically, culturally.\\nThe emphases, and the omis\\nsions too, reflect my own\\njudgment of what is most\\ninteresting and important in\\nGreek history.\".\\nSo we have summary\\nstudies of what Dr. Finley\\ntakes to be the essence of\\nthis or that aspect of Greek\\nlife. He goes far beneath\\nthe surface; at the same\\ntime he supports his theories\\nwith facts, and—just as im\\nportant-indicates where the\\nattrition of time seems to\\nhave distorted (or destroyed)\\n\\' the record.\\n“The Ancient Greeks.\" for\\nall its selectivity, proceeds\\nchronologically, so that it\\naffords a general picture\\nof the development of Greek\\nsociety. It is always very dif\\nficult to blend the chrono\\nlogical and the topical ap\\nproaches, and the shorter the\\nbook, the greater the diffi\\nculty. Dr.yFinley has over\\ncome the problems, and this\\nin itself accounts for a good\\npart of his success.\\nPerhaps even more impor\\ntant is his feel for the na\\nture of human society. The\\nrational and the irrational\\nare legitimate opposite poles,\\nand one or the other may\\ndominate at any given time\\nin a human community,\\nthough judgment is likely to\\nbe highly subjective. But\\nwhat is more Important is\\nthe blending of the two in\\nvarious aspects and strata of\\nsociety. Careful study by it\\nself will not illuminate the\\nnature of the bend; one\\nneeds Dr. Finley\\'s sense of\\nsociety.\\n\"The Ancient Greeks” is\\nintended for the general\\nreader. It is fair to assume\\nthat not many are passion\\nate lovers of classical antiq\\nuity. Perhaps Dr. Finley will\\nmake a few converts.\\nevergreen related to heather\\nthat has pinkish or fresh\\ncolored. waxy flowers and\\ndark green, sharply toothed,\\nleatherly leaves that grow in\\nwhorls or in opposition on\\nthe stem.

For the antidiscrimina\\ntion amendment which they offered was\\npolitically motivated and threatened\\nthe life of a much-needed piece of\\nlegislation.\\nThe amendment ostensibly was In\\ntended to guarantee that Negroes, hard\\nest hit In the present unemployment\\npattern, would not be denied vocational\\ntraining in schools aided by Federal\\nfunds. But there could not have been\\na legislator in the House so naive as to\\nbelieve that this was the real purpose.\\nActually, it was a transparent at\\ntempt to booby-trap the bill with a\\ncondition the Senate would never buy.\\nThe upshot was the strange spectacle\\nof liberal Democrats joining a Negro\\nmember in arguing against a civil rights\\nproposal.\\nBefore he voted against It, Rep\\nresentative Hawkins, a Negro freshman\\nmember from California, said “the real\\ndanger of this amendment is that it\\nwill defeat the bill and deprive more\\nNegroes of needed training than even\\nIvhltes.” That was because In the Deep\\npouth and elsewhere, he said, white\\npeople could go to private schools\\nNegroes could not afford.\\nAs finally passed and sent unen\\ncumbered to the Senate, the bill prom\\nises to strengthen job training by au\\nthorizing $450 million In Federal grants\\nover the next four years, in addition to\\n$57 million already available annually.\\nMore adults and young people, such\\nas school dropouts, would be reached\\nthrough more schools teaching latest\\njob methods. It is a good bill.

We wish him\\nwell and we wish to express our grati\\ntude for his many substantial contribu\\ntions to his country.\\nOn the calendar one of these con\\ntributions consists of over half of a\\nlong life given to public service, almost\\nentirely in the highest levels of our\\nnational Government. But this record of\\nservice, almost unparalleled in modem\\nAmerican history, is much more signifi\\ncant than the simple weight of years.\\nAs the passing of time clarifies our view\\nof the past, Herbert Hoover emerges\\nmore and more as a key figure of our\\nera. In several important ways, he was\\nthe first American in a position of power\\nto be aware of and to address himself\\nto basic problems that we think of as\\ntypical of the immediate present and\\nthe future.\\nFirst and foremost, he was an en\\ngineer. In his youth he practiced his\\nprofession in China, meeting at first\\nhand, in the early years of this century,\\nthe problem of industrial revolution\\nthat will surely dominate the century’s\\nend. Long before World War I, he was\\na confirmed internationalist, with bases\\nin San Francisco, New York and London\\nand operations in Russia, Australia,\\nAsia, the Americas and Europe. With the\\noutbreak of the great war, Herbert\\nHoover, in conquered Belgium, became\\nthe first of a new American breed, the\\n“relief administrator.” When America\\nentered the war, he returned home as\\nPresident Wilson’s food administrator.\\nAt the war’s end he was back in Europe\\nproviding the daily bread of people in\\n30 countries, and managing the rail\\nways, waterways, ports and mines of\\nEastern Europe.\\nHis career in that time marked\\nthe emergence of America as the sup\\nport and guide of the free world. That\\nhis country repudiated that role be\\ntween the world wars in no way lessens\\nthe importance of his pioneering work.\\nWhen, after World War n, we accepted\\nthat responsibility again, we built on\\nfoundations laid by Herbert Hoover.\\nTo some extent it was as an engi\\nneer, the modern man, that Herbert\\nHoover was elected our thirty-first\\nPresident in 1928. Four years later he\\nwas bitterly rejected as the engineer\\nwho had failed. By 1932 this shaken\\nNation needed a scapegoat and Hoover\\nwas the logical candidate.\\nFor President Truman, Herbert\\nHoover resumed his old task of feeding\\nthe hungry in Europe and assisting in\\nthe creation of new governments there.\\nBut there was another engineer’s in\\nterest for which we are his debtors.\\nSince his earliest days in govern\\nment, he had been fascinated and\\nappalled by the self-generative powers of\\nthe bureaucracy and by the increasing\\ndifficulty of getting anything done in\\ngovernment. These problems have only\\nin the last two years commended them\\nselves to the serious attention of liberal\\nthought: Hoover was onto them decades\\nago. For Truman and again for Elsen\\nhower, the ex-President conducted ex\\nhaustive investigations of governmental\\ninertia and duplication. His hundreds\\nof specific recommendations were sec\\nonded by both Presidents and most were\\nput into practice.\\nThe shadow of Herbert Hoover upon\\nthis Nation’s history has proved to be\\nmuch longer than anyone imagined 30\\nyears ago. Scholar, patriot, human!-\\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 10, 1963\\ntarian and insistent voice of the Ameri\\ncan heritage, Herbert Clark Hoover, en\\ngineer, has built mightily for his coun\\ntry’s good.\\nMadame Nhu\\'s Tongue\\nMadame Ngo Dinh \\'Nhu, sister-in\\nlaw of South Viet Nam’s President Diem,\\nis a remarkable woman. Petite, very\\npretty, highly intelligent and articulate,\\nshe is a political power in her own right\\n—but an exceedingly controversial one,\\nwith an exceptionally sharp and rest\\nless tongue. Indeed, she seems congenit\\nally disposed to say the sort of extrava\\ngant and outrageous things that tend\\nto increase, rather than abate, her coun\\ntry’s internal tensions.\\nThus, wholly apart from her efforts\\nto impose an absurdly unrealistic super\\npuritanical code of morals on South\\nViet Nam, Madame Nhu, a devout Ro\\nman Catholic, has recently given voice\\nto tasteless and unjustifiably harsh at\\ntacks on the country’s Buddhists. These\\nattacks have been so extreme, in fact,\\nthat her father, who is himself a Budd\\nhist and Ambassador to the United\\nStates, has issued a statement—in be\\nhalf of the Diem government—disavow\\ning her remarks as irresponsible and\\nshowing a “lack of respect” for sincere\\nbelievers in Buddhism.\\nAnd now, on top of all this, the\\nirrepressible and ever-loquacious Ma\\ndame Nhu has got herself into hot water\\nwith our State Department. She has\\ndone so by declaring in an interview\\nwith the New York Times that the\\nUnited States Embassy in Saigon has\\n“threatened and blackmailed” the Diem\\ngovernment in an effort to “shut me\\nup.” Wisely enough, however, the de\\npartment has played it cool. Speaking\\nthrough Press Officer Richard I. Phil\\nlips, it has brushed her off with these\\nwords: “We don’t wish to comment on\\nMadame Nhu’s utterances, especially in\\nview of the fact that she does not have\\nany official position in the Vietnamese\\nadministration.”\\nThis is the proper way to deal with\\nthis strong-willed woman, who never\\nfights shy of publicity. Actually, in his\\nown relationship with her as his hostess,\\nbachelor President Diem may sometimes\\nhave in mind, in a wry sense, the words\\nof Samuel Johnson: “I am very fond\\nof the company of ladies. I like their\\nbeauty, I like their delicacy, I like their\\nvivacity, and I like their silence.” Or\\nhe may occasionally recall the Old\\nTestament proverb: “It is better to dwell\\nin a corner of the house-top than with\\na brawling woman in a wide house.”\\nThe Art of Taxes\\nIt is good that the House Ways and\\nMeans Committee proposes to ease by a\\nlittle the tax lot of the author, actor and\\nathlete. In those professions and in\\nothers, the road to solvency is not, as it\\nis for most of us, a slow and steady\\nuphill climb comparable to the grade\\nschedules of the Civil Service. Quite\\noften, in entertainment, sport and the\\narts, solvency is achieved only by a kind\\nof financial “overkill.” One year the\\nactor is starving; the next he’s a mil\\nlionaire.\\nUntil now our tax law has ignored\\nthis difference in pattern. When an\\nartist or entertainer has “made it big,”\\nhe is taxed in his new bracket just like\\nthe top business executive who has been\\nin the bracket for years.\\nTo most thoughtful people, this has\\nnot been fair, nor has it represented ra\\ntional treatment of the talent that is a\\nnatural resource we all benefit from.\\nUnder the new proposals, the taxpayer\\nmaking more than a third more than\\nhis average income of the previous four\\nyears will be permitted to pay taxes as\\nif the high income had been earned over\\nfive years.\\nThe committee is to be especially\\ncongratulated because the taxpayers\\naffected are notably without political\\npower, being the most highly individ\\nualistic and unorganized group on the\\nrolls of Internal Revenue. The* new ar\\nrangement will be more in accord not\\nonly with the financial facts of an\\n• athlete’s or an author’s life, but also\\nwith the nature of the work itself.\\nThe celebrated reply of the Amer\\nican painter, James Whistler, applies as\\nwell to the writing of a book or the per\\nfection of a talent for sinking long putts.\\nAsked how long it had taken him to\\npaint a picture, Whistler answered in\\nsimple truth, “All my life.”\\nSticky Enlistments\\nSome days it is hard to tell who\\nis sniffing the most glue, the kids or\\nthe adults. Take that Navy officer who\\nis objecting to a District proposal to\\ncontrol the sale of the sticky stuff.\\nHe reasons that if kids don’t get\\nglue, they won’t build model airplanes,\\nand if they don’t build models, they\\nwon’t enlist in the aviation services.\\nApparently it doesn’t matter about\\nthe boys who buy the glue for kicks\\nand, in the process, often suffer serious\\nhealth Injury.\\nPerhaps the theory is that, given\\nample glue to sniff, a young man will\\nbe woozy enough to walk into the\\nnearest recruiting office and give him\\nself up. But any recruiter who would\\ndepend on glue to make his quotas must\\nhave been sniffing the stuff himself.\\n& > •* ■\\n\\'At Least It Got the Profumo Case Off the Front Page\\'\\nLETTERS TO THE STAR\\nMass Transit\\nGib Crockett is one of the\\ngreatest. I have admired him\\nfor years, particularly in view\\nof the fact that he usually\\nstays with the facts and\\nadroitly castigates deceit and\\nuntruths.\\nSo it is difficult to under\\nstand why he reversed thia\\nformula 100 per cent in his\\ncartoon on July 31, in which\\nhe pictures the so-called\\n“highway lobby” rolling over\\nthe “mass transit plan.”\\nNot one member of any in\\ndustry connected even re\\nmotely with highways has\\never said a word against a\\n“mass transit plan.\" In fact,\\nevery member of the high\\nway-oriented industries have\\ngone on record as definitely\\nfavoring a “mass transit\\nplan.\"\\nThere are several types of\\n“mass transit plans’* and\\nthere is much controversy as\\nto which is the best “mass\\ntransit plan” for the people\\nof the National Capital area.\\nThe NCTA, in order to fur\\nther its recommendations for\\na railroad mass transit plan,\\nhas endeavored to “sink the\\nhighways.” It has asked the\\ntaxpayers of our Metropoli\\ntan Area to give up over *6OO\\nmillion of highways and free\\nways for which we have paid\\nand for which we are con\\ntinuing to pay under the Fed\\neral Highway Act whether we\\nget these freeways or not.\\nFurthermore, NCTA has asked\\nus to dig down into our over\\nburdened taxpockets to fi\\nnance an additional *2 billion\\nrailroad “mass transit” sys\\ntem. (*1 billion for cost; *1\\nbillion for interest.)\\nEveryone in the mass trans\\nportation field knows that\\nrail mass transit was obso\\nleted in the teens and the\\ntwenties from the point of\\nview of normal good business\\neconomics. It just simply\\ncannot pay its way.\\nConversely, bus mass\\ntransit not only does pay its\\nway but puts back into the\\nIn Defense of Congressional Staffing\\nA review by Star Staff\\nWriter Robert K. Walsh of\\nProf. Kenneth Kofmehl’s re\\ncent book, “Professional\\nStaffs of Congress,” was read\\ninto the Congressional Rec\\nord on July 22, so comment\\nseems pertinent. Prof. Kof\\nmehl has indeed performed\\nan interesting task by study\\ning in detail the operation of\\nthe congressional committee\\nstaffing system in its forma\\ntive years, after the Legis\\nlative Reorganization Act of\\n1946. However, both he and\\nyour reviewer seem to have\\nIgnored several important\\nproblems in the area of\\nminority staffing.\\nProf. Kofmehl assumes\\nthat the main function of\\nCongressmen is to act as\\nintimate agencies for their\\nconstituents, and that, there\\nfore, the principal danger is\\nexcessive staffing which will\\nlead to the overinstitutional\\nization of members of Con\\ngress.\\nHowever, since Congress\\nmen are delegates to a na\\ntional legislature, their func\\ntion is\\'to deal with national\\nproblems in the national\\ninterest as seen from their\\ndistricts, not to be mere\\nerrand boys for those dis\\ntricts. It is true that histor\\nically Congress has often\\nserved in the latter capacity,\\nbut now, in the mld-20th\\ncentury, with national prob\\nlems growing more and\\nmore complex, our Nation\\ncan no longer afford this\\nluxury, and the realization\\nis growing among Congress\\nmen that if Congress is to\\nretain its constitutional role\\nin our governmental system,\\nit must equip itself to deal\\nmore effectively with na\\ntional problems. This has\\ninitiated a fresh Interest by\\nCongress in congressional\\nreform. It is scarcely be\\nlievable that a political sci\\nentist would wish to dis\\ncourage this attempt at re\\nform and reconsign Congress\\nto a role it wrongly acquired\\nand is attempting to discard.\\nMinority staffing is only a\\nsingle facet, though an im\\nportant one. of the entire\\nproblem of increased con\\ngressional staffing to equip\\nCongress to better fill its\\nPen names may be used if\\nletters carry writers’ correct\\nnames and addresses.

The exec\\nutive branch today is this\\ncountry’s largest pressure\\ngroup. Every Federal depart\\nment and agency is a lobby\\nwith a vested interest in suc\\ncessfully acquiring new ap\\npropriations, continuing old\\nand initiating new programs.\\nAdministrative staffs un\\navoidably reflect this bias.\\nEspecially when the Presi\\ndent and both branches of\\nCongress are controlled by\\nthe same party; that is,\\nwhen the same party con\\ntrols both the congres\\nsional and also the vast\\nresources of the administra\\ntive staff, it becomes impera\\ntive for the minority party in\\nCongress (now the Repub\\nlicans) to have adequate staff\\nresources responsible to it, in\\norder to fulfill the obliga\\ntions of a responsible minor\\nity party to the Nation —to be\\ninformed, to criticize con\\nstructively, to check the\\nExecutive, and to propose\\nsoundly-researched alterna\\ntive legislation.\\nTo imply, as Prof. Kofmehl\\ndoes, that congressional\\nstaffs can be nonpartisan,\\nsimply Ignores political reality.\\nObviously staff members will\\nhave an allegiance to those\\nmembers of a committee (the\\nnow Democratic majority)\\nwho hire and fire, promote\\nand demote them, and have\\nfirst claim on their time.\\nIs not the proper function\\nof committees, as servants of\\ntheir House, to expose issues\\nI for full floor debate?

But how long\\nit will endure, or whether it\\nwill expand or disintegrate\\ninto war, none may say.\\nIt was in August that the\\nthe great powers went to war\\nin 1914. The 20th Century\\nwas then but 14 years old—\\nan infant. Millions died in\\nthat war, the first to be\\nmechanized with tanks- air\\ncraft, new and terrible ma\\nchineguns, flame throwers,\\nand poison gas. We proceed\\ned on, with the coming of\\ndictators to the second world\\nwar. It introduced still more\\nmarvelous\\nhuge bombers, fast fighters,\\nflyl ig bombs, monstrous\\ntanks, and landing craft for\\namphibious war. There also\\nwas a new element gas\\nchambers. And into them\\nwent millions of men, women\\nand children whose only sin\\nwas that one of the dictators\\nthought they should be de-\\n1968. In their opinion the\\nGovernor would be through.\\nThe other move on the part\\nof the Republican liberals is\\nthe recent creation of a \"Re\\npublican Critical Issues Coun\\ncil” an offspring of the\\nRepublican Citizens group or\\nganized at a meeting at\\nHershey, Pa., with the bless\\ning of former President\\nDwight D. Eisenhower. This\\nRepublican Citizens group, it\\nwas announced, would help\\norganize the grass roots vot\\ners, particularly independents\\nand disgruntled Democrats. It\\nwould keep its hands off party\\npolicies and the contest for\\nthe presidential nomination.\\nNow comes the RCIC, whose\\nchairman is Dr. Milton Eisen\\nhower, the former President’s\\nbrother, and membership of\\nwhich includes several for\\nmer cabinet officers in the\\nEisenhower administration.\\nAnd it plans to write about\\npolitical Issues of the day.\\nWhat it writes will scarcely\\nbe along conservative Re\\npublican lines, along lines\\nthat Senator Goldwater be\\nlieves sound.\\nCouncil as an Irritant\\nIssues make themselves.\\nThey are not made by a Re\\npublican Critical Issues Coun\\ncil, any more than they were\\nmade by the now defunct\\nDemocratic Advisory Council,\\nwhich functioned from No\\nvember, 1956, until Presi\\ndent Kennedy was nominated\\nin 1960. The Democratic Ad\\nvisory Council was authorized\\nby the Executive Committee\\nof the Democratic National\\nCommittee and appointed by\\nthe then Democratic na\\ntional chairman, the late\\nPaul Butler. If it had any in\\nfluence on the Democratic\\nleadership in Congress and the\\nvotes cast in the Senate and\\nHouse, it was not visible to\\nthe naked eye. This new Re\\npublican Council has no con\\nnection with the party’s na\\ntional organization. It is not\\nreceived with cheers by the\\nRepublican leadership in Con\\ngress. But it can be an irri\\ntant to the national commit\\ntee and to the Republicans\\nin Congress, who may think\\nthat the money it uses could\\nbe put to better campaign\\npurposes.\\nAs for G. O. P. presidential\\npossibilities, some of the op\\nponents of Senator Goldwater\\nhave no love for Gov. Rocke\\nfeller as a nominee. If neither\\nis the final selection, it could\\nbe a Romney, a Scranton or\\na Morton. There has been\\ntalk of the G. O. P., in des\\nperation, turning to former\\nPresident Eisenhower, or to\\nformer Vice President Nixon.\\nGen. Eisenhower, under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment to\\nthe Constitution, cannot be\\nelected President. That the\\nparty will turn again to Mr.\\nNixon, defeated for President\\nin 1960 and for Governor of\\nCalifornia in 1962, is just a\\npart of the mid-summer\\nmadness.\\nstroyed so he could build a\\nsuper race of his own kind.\\nNow the 20th century is\\n63 years old, and we have\\nnuclear weapons and mis\\nsiles that orbit the earth.\\nThe testing of them is, as\\ni aforesaid, registered in the\\n■ bones of mankind, in ani\\n; mals, in the grasses, the\\nseas, rivers, earth and air.\\nNor is that all.

In the other 10\\nStates, where the unemploy\\nment load is heavy, the new\\ntax will not be sufficient to pay\\nthe unemployed.\\nBut in view of the admin\\nistration’s Senate victory, the\\nnew revenue will be pooled as\\na national fund to meet the\\ncosts of the payments wherever\\nthey are made.\\nIf the Finance Committee\\nview had prevailed, the 40\\nStates with surplus tax collec\\ntions would have been credited\\nwith those surpluses, which\\nmight have permitted reduc\\ntions later on. The 10 deficit\\nStates would have been re\\nquired to levy higher taxes on\\ntheir employers starting in\\n1964 to make up their differ\\nence.\\nSenator Albert Gore, Demo\\ncrat of Tennessee, led the suc\\ncessful fight to treat the prob\\nlem and the tax collections on\\na Nation-wide basis.

A. O’LEARY\\nStar Staff Writer\\nLabor Secretary Wirtz as\\nsured the Senate Commerce\\nCommittee today that he will\\nsupport a fair employment\\npractice law as one step Con\\ngress should take in the field\\nof civil rights. He also indorsed\\nin principle one of the two\\namendments offered by Sena\\ntor Goldwater, Republican of\\nArizona, which would deprive\\na union of the right to be ex\\nclusive bargaining agent if it\\ndiscriminates in the admission\\nof members to the union.\\nAs to the second Goldwater\\namendment, the Secretary did\\nnot commit himself. That\\namendment would authorize\\nthe Attorney General to file\\nsuits In behalf of individual\\nunion members who have\\ngrievances against their union\\nleaders, based on the Lan\\ndrum-Griffin labor law.\\nWould Help Union Members\\nMr. Wirtz siad there must be\\nsome misunderstanding, be\\ncause Congress ommitted from\\nthe Landrum-Griffin law any\\nreference to civil rglhts com\\nplaints.\\nWhen Senator Goldwater in\\ntroduced his amendments, how\\never, he made it clear that he\\nwanted the Attorney General\\nto help union members enforce\\nwhatever rights they have un\\nder the Landrum-Griffin Act\\nin the same way that the At\\ntorney General would file suits\\nInvolving racial discrimination\\namong customers in places of\\npublic accommodation.\\nSenator Cotton, Republican\\nof New Hampshire, contended\\nthat Congress would not be\\npassing a “whole bill” if it\\nmerely prohibited an establish\\nment from discriminating be\\ntween customers but left it\\nfree to discriminate in hiring\\nemployes.\\nMr. Wirtz said that was a\\nvery proper question, and would\\nbe covered by a fair employ\\nment practice bill, “which we\\nsupport.” He said the only\\nreason FEPC was not included\\nin the administration package\\nwas because separate bills on\\nthat subject were already pend\\ning.\\nSenator Lausche, Democrat\\nof Ohio, also questioned Mr.\\nWirtz on the question of treat\\ning labor unions the same as\\nall others in eliminating dis\\ncrimination.\\nDemocratic Senator Harri\\nson Williams and Republican\\nSenator Case, both of New\\nJersey, also testified today in\\nfavor of a Federal public ac\\ncommodations law.\\nIn his prepared statement.\\nSecretary Wirtz contended that\\nelimination of segregation in\\nplaces of public accommoda\\ntion would stimulate the\\necomony and help relieve un\\nemployment.\\nAt their weekly news con\\nference today, House Republi\\ncan leader Haleck and Senate\\nRepublican Leader Dirksen\\nsaid they have had no time\\ntable from Democratic leaders\\nas to when civil rights will\\nreach the floor, or whether the\\ndebate will start in the House\\nor Senate. Democratic leaders\\nhave said privately, however,\\nTHE EVENING STAR\\nWashington, D. C., Thursday, July It, 1963\\nthey expect the House to act\\nfirst.\\nSenator Dirksen said he\\nhestiated to speculate about a\\nSenate filibuster, but added,\\n“unless all signs fall, this is\\nnot going to slide through the\\nSenate very easily.\"\\nSecretary Wirtz testified that\\n\"inequality of opportunity and\\nthe unrest it fosters hurts\\nemployment.\\n“If Negroes felt as free to\\ntravel and explore this country\\nas white families of similar\\nincome,” Mr Wirtz continued,\\n‘the economic stimulus would\\nbe very large indeed in the\\ntransportation, apparel, travel\\ngoods, sports, gifts, and camp\\ning goods industries, and in\\nthe full range of service indus\\ntries—hotels, motels, and eat\\ning and drinking establish\\nments.”\\nKennedy Backs Bills\\nPresident Kennedy told his\\nnews conference yesterday he\\nwants both the civil rights bill\\nand his proposals for reducing\\nand revising taxes enacted this\\nyear. The fight over the civil\\nrights measure Is regarded by\\nsome members of Congress as\\njeopardizing chances for pas\\nsage of a tax bill.\\nMr. Kennedy also said he\\nthought it is “a convenient\\nscapegoat” to suggest that all\\nthe country’s racial difficulties\\nare Communist- Inspired.\\nHe was asked about conten\\ntions by Govs. George C. Wal\\nlace of Alabama and Ross\\nBarnett of Mississippi before\\nthe Senate Commerce Com\\nmittee that Communists were\\nbehind the integration demon\\nstrations.\\nWhile Communists obviously\\nwould try to worm their way\\ninto any movement where there\\nis trouble, Mr. Kennedy said,\\nthe Government has no evi\\ndence that any of the leaders\\nof the civil rights movements\\nin the United States are Com\\nmunists, and no evidence that\\nthe demonstrations are Com\\nmunist-inspired.\\nIraqi Planes Attack\\nINSTANBUL, Turkey, July\\n18 (AP).—Three Iraqi jets and\\na bomber attacked a Turkish\\nborder outpost near Hakkari\\nlast night with rockets and ma\\nchine guns, press reports said.\\nA-5'},\n",

Attorney Vin\\ncent A. Theisen, of Wilming\\nton. and the Solicitor General\\n; maintained that:\\n1. Delaware’s three countiesi\\ntalked too long about the need\\nto reduce high war-time tax\\nrates. “We have about reached\\nthe point where it is desirable\\nto see what would come out”\\nof a tax cut, he said.\\nMr. Martin warned that tax\\ncuts will increase budget\\ndeficits, and Treasury borrow\\ning to finance these deficits\\nmay raise interest rates for\\nprivate borrowers.\\nThis will happen, he said, if\\nthe tax bill stimulates the econ\\nomy to the point where busi\\nness needs more credit to\\nexpand.\\nIt would be a mistake. Mr.\\nMartin said, for the Federal\\nReserve to ease monetary pol\\nicy in an effort to hold interest\\nrates down in such circum\\nstances.\\nIf the Federal Reserve tried\\nto help the Treasury finance\\nthe deficit in that way, he said,\\nthe process would amount to\\n’ printing money and causing in\\ni flation.\\ni He said the Treasury must\\nnever were sovereign units, and\\nthus are unlike States given\\nequal representation in the\\nUnited States Senate in the\\ncompromise that formed the |\\nNation.\\n2. In any event, State Sena\\ntors in Delaware do not rep\\nresent counties. Under a 1963\\nreapportionment, 21 Senators\\nare divided among election dis-1\\ntricts in the three counties,\\nseven in each county.\\n3. While Congress apportions\\nits House of Representatives by\\npopulation. Delaware does not.\\nTwenty-eight per cent of the\\nfinance budget deficits to the\\nmaximum practical extent by\\nborrowing out of savings, not\\nby reliance on selling bonds\\nto the banking system. In\\ncreased sales of bonds to the\\nbanking system would require\\nthe Federal Reserve to follow\\neasy money policies, greatly ex\\npanding the supply of money\\nand credit.\\nMr. Martin said budget defi\\ncits in the past couple of years\\nhave been financed without in\\nflation. and he expressed con\\nfidence that the same process\\ni can continue after taxes are\\ncut—at the price of higher in\\nterest rates.\\n’ The Federal Reserve\\'s re-\\n■ sponsibility for preventing in\\nflation causes criticism.

Then, or\\nso the claims went, the race would be\\nwide open and anything could happen.\\nThe nominating speeches, innocent\\nof anything resembling a fresh thought,\\nand the dreary demonstrations dragged\\nalong. From time to time something\\npopped up to relieve the monotony.\\nSenator Symington had to deny a broad\\ncast rumor that he was going to with\\ndraw in favor of Senator Kennedy. A\\nsimilar report was denied by a spokes\\nman for Senator Johnson. When Adlai\\nStevenson’s name was put in nomina\\ntion the demonstration for him was\\nlong, loud and appeared to be more\\nor less spontaneous. Most of the noise\\nmay have come from the Stevenson\\nrooters who had no votes, but the show\\nwas fervent enough to encourage a be\\nlief that maybe something was in the\\nworks after all.\\nIt was a mood that was not to\\nlast long. Senator Kennedy began to\\npull away soon after the first ballot\\nbegan. Senator Symington and Mr.\\nStevenson were never in the race. Lyn\\ndon Johnson, who had shown signs of\\ndesperation earlier in the day, moved\\npast the 400 mark, but he never came\\nclose to the 500 or more votes which\\nhe had predicted for himself. As it\\nhappened, Wyoming cast the ballots\\nwhich brought the winner up to the\\nmagic number—76l. At the end of the\\nroll call Senator Kennedy had 806. Then\\nthe delegates made it unanimous Sen\\nator Johnson, who had given up and\\ngone to bed, put out a statement con\\ngratulating the winner and promising\\nfull support in the election campaign.\\nSenator Kennedy, accompanied by his\\nmother, a sister and friends, came down\\nto the convention hall, where he made\\na little talk promising to carry the bat\\ntle to the enemy and appealing for the\\nsupport of a united party. Then, in\\nthe early hours, he left for what was\\ndescribed as a conference with vice\\npresidential prospects. The battle was\\nover and the 43-year-old great grand\\nson of a penniless Irish Immigrant,\\nwho left Ireland to escape the famine,\\nhad emerged as the Democratic Party’s\\nchoice for the White House, for an\\noffice of enormous responsibilities, an\\noffice upon which ride the hopes of\\nour own country and the whole free\\nworld.\\nWhat kind of man is this youthful\\ncandidate? And why did the conven\\ntion turn to him—the youngest and\\nthe least experienced of the party’s\\nfour major aspirants?\\nThe Kennedy image has become\\nfamiliar to most people through his\\ntelevised appearances. And it will be\\ncome better known as the campaign\\nmoves along. He is articulate, intelli\\ngent, poised and blessed with a talent\\nfor winning friends instead of alienat\\ning people. If there are doubts that\\nMr. Kennedy is old enough and rugged\\nenough to stand up to Mr. Khrushchev,\\nthis young man may still prove harder\\nand tougher than one might think.\\nThe second question is easier. Su\\nperior organization, months of very hard\\nwork, the Kennedy money—all of these\\nwent into the successful pre-convention\\ncampaign. But above all else the Mas\\nsachusetts Senator had stamped him\\nself in the minds of the delegates as\\na winner. Os the four real aspirants\\nlast night, Senator Kennedy—and only\\nSenator Kennedy—had gone into the\\nprimaries and demonstrated that he\\nhad voter appeal. In Wisconsin he de\\nfeated Senator Humphrey and displayed\\nsome strength with the farmers. In\\nWest Virginia he again trounced the\\nMinnesota Senator and, more impor\\ntantly, he showed he could win in a\\nState with a negligible Catholic vote.\\nIn Oregon, of course, he clobbered the\\nfield, including Senator Morse, the\\nhometown boy.\\nIt is said, with some truth, that\\nSenator Kennedy never had to com\\npete against a serious competitor in\\nthe primaries. But that was not his\\nfault. His major rivals, or at least\\nsome of them, could have entered had\\nthey wanted to do so. Their seeming\\nreluctance to meet the front runner\\nhead-on served to aid the Kennedy\\nTHURSDAY, JULY 14, 1960\\nr build-up. He looked like a winner, he\\n• performed like a winner, and if there\\nis anything that is dear to the hearts\\nof politicians it is a candidate who, in\\ntheir judgment, can win. So the Demo\\ncrats, swallowing whatever misgivings\\nthey may have had, decided last night\\nto put their chips down on the young\\nman from Massachusetts.\\nU. N. to the Rescue\\nThe extraordinary emergency ses\\nsion of the United Nations Security\\nCouncil has resulted in action designed\\nto save the Congo Republic from com\\nplete anarchy and dissolution. The\\naction, taken in response to an urgent\\nappeal from the distraught government\\nof the fledgling new nation, has set\\nin motion a plan devised by Secretary\\nGeneral Dag Hammarsjkold to restore\\nmilitary discipline to the country’s mu\\ntinous army, meet certain critical needs\\nin the Congolese economy and bring\\nabout general stability.\\nIn connection with all this, the\\nKremlin has accused the United States\\nand other Western powers of having\\naided Belgium in “unleashing armed\\naggression” against its former colony.\\nActually, of course, the “armed aggres\\nsion” has consisted solely and simply\\nof measures to protect thousands of\\nBelgians and other Europeans from the\\nnative troops who have been on a ram\\npage ever since the advent of independ\\nence a fortnight ago. Clearly, the So\\nviet condemnation of such protective\\naction can only be described as yet an\\nother example of the maliciousness and\\nutter untruthfulness of communism’s\\ncurrent all-out propaganda drive against\\nthe free world in general and our own\\ncountry in particular.\\nNevertheless, when the time came\\nto vote in the 11-Nation Security Coun\\ncil early this morning, the Russian dele\\ngate voted with seven other members\\n(including the United States) in favor\\nof the Tunisian resolution backing the\\nHammarsjkold plan. As a result (France,\\nBritain and Nationalist China abstained\\non the ground that the resolution im\\nplicitly censures the Belgians for ag\\ngression), the following program is to\\nbe put into operation with all possible\\nspeed: (1) The immediate dispatch of\\na small group of military officers, wear\\ning U. N. uniforms, to help the Con\\ngolese government build up a disciplined\\narmy. (2) Emergency shipment of food\\nto head off threatened acute shortages.\\nAnd (3) the stationing in the country\\nof a special United Nations force, which\\nwould be made up chiefly of contingents\\nfrom African states and which would\\nbe much the same as the force on duty\\nin the Gaza Strip along the Israeli-\\nEgyptian border.\\nAt the same time, in approving\\naction along this line, the Council has\\nrequested Belgium to withdraw its forces\\nfrom the Congo Republic, but no time\\nlimit has been fixed as to that. Pre\\nsumably the withdrawal will take place\\nwhen, as and if Mr. Hammarsjkold’s\\nrescue mission succeeds in helping the\\nKasavubu-Lumumba government to re\\nstore order. The “if” here is very big,\\nhowever, and one must keep one’s\\nfingers crossed even while hoping for\\nthe best.\\n\\'Symbol of Democracy\\'\\nIn contrast to the excessive and\\noften meaningless rhetoric of parts of\\nthe Democratic platform, the three\\nparagraph section on the District of\\nColumbia is a model of succinctness. No\\nmore fitting occasion than a presidential\\nnominating convention could be found\\nto express support for the constitutional\\namendment granting Washingtonians\\nthe right to vote for President and Vice\\nPresident. This support had a special\\ntimeliness, furthermore, since 47 State\\nlegislatures—the majority of them con\\ntrolled by Democrats—are scheduled to\\nmeet next year, and the Los Angeles\\ndelegates can perform no greater service\\nto the District than to carry the ratifi\\ncation plea back to their homes.\\nWe also commend the language of\\nthe platform which recommends con\\ngressional passage of a second constitu\\ntional amendment to grant District resi\\ndents representation in Congress. In\\naddition, the convention reaffirmed the\\ntraditional party position in favor of\\nsome form of home rule legislation. The\\nImmediate need, however, and the one\\ntoward which Washington should mo\\nbilize its major effort In 1961, is ratifica\\ntion of the 23d Amendment. That action\\nwould be a notable advance toward\\nthe goal of the convention—the Na\\ntion’s Capital should be a “symbol of\\ndemocracy to people throughout the\\nworld.”\\nMexico and Cuba\\nTwo leading members of Mexico’s\\nCongress have spoken out in a manner\\nsuggesting that the government of\\nPresident Adolfo Lopez Mateos can be\\ncounted upon by Fidel Castro to side\\nwith Cuba in its worsening dispute with\\nthe United States. But the uneasiness\\ncreated in Washington by this state\\nment—a statement implying strong\\nsupport for the Havana regime, right\\nor wrong—seems to have been unwar\\nranted. At any rate, official assurances\\nto that effect have just beeen offered by\\nMexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello.\\nThus, in a formal clarifying state\\nment designed to eliminate unfounded\\nmisgivings, Mr. Tello has declared that\\nalthough President Lopez Mateos natur\\nally hopes for an amicable settlement\\nof the trouble between our country and\\nCuba, the two legislators have spoken\\nonly for themselves, not for the govern\\nment. In short, members of Mexico’s\\nCongress are like members of our own\\nCongress in that their words do not\\nnecessarily reflect the policy of the\\nexecutive branch. It is reassuring to\\nhave this stated officially by the Foreign\\nMinister.\\nHF\" ‘\"TyW»\\'\\nPI i \\\\ ■\\'\\nwz r\\n\\'l\\'m Ready for Him . . .

She made an ap\\npeal for her favorite candi\\ndate, and couched thd ap\\npeal in glowing terms. She\\nsaid Mr. Stevenson was the\\nbest qualified man—the man\\nthe Nation needs in these\\ndays of stress and strain.\\nFormer Senator Herbert\\nLehman of New York, once\\nGovernor of that State, was\\nas emphatic as Mrs. Roose\\nvelt in his praise for Mr.\\nStevenson and in his warn\\ning that a man of wide\\nknowledge of international\\naffairs should be nominated\\nand elected President. Lt.\\nGov. Glenn Anderson of\\nCalifornia and Lt. Gov. Wil\\nson Wyatt of Kentucky also\\nseconded the nomination of\\nMr. Stevenson. It was Sena\\ntor Eugene McCarthy of\\nMinnesota who placed the\\nStevenson name before the\\nconvention.\\nThe appeals of this galaxy\\nof Democratic stars had no\\neffect on the delegates—\\nalthough their pleas were\\naccompanied by the loudest\\nand most enthusiastic dem\\nonstration seen in the con\\nvention hall.\\nAgrees to “Draft”\\nIt should be said, of course,\\nthat Mr. Stevenson never be\\ncame an announced candi\\ndate, although he finally said\\nthat he would not run away\\nfrom a “draft,” and agreed\\nto permit his friends to place\\nhis name in nomination at\\nthe convention.\\nIndeed, Mr. Stevenson made\\nno campaign at all. But the\\nhard core of the old Steven\\nson following-- of 1952 and\\n1956 did their best to stir\\ninterest throughout the coun\\ntry. Mr. Stevenson, then\\nGovernor of Illinois, actually\\nwas drafted in 1952. At that\\ntime he was a candidate for\\nre-election as Governor and\\nTHIS AND THAT\\nBy CHARLES E.

Never\\ntheless, a Senate group, or at least the\\nRepublican members thereof, are quiz\\nzing the late President’s son with a\\nview to \"marking” his selection by\\nPresident Kennedy as Undersecretary of\\nCommerce.\\nThis does not make any great Im\\npression on us. If Mr. Kennedy had\\ncombed the country over he might have\\ncome up with a better candidate for this\\npost. Back In the rugged days of the\\nWest Virginia Democratic primary, how\\never, F. D.

Maybe they didn’t care and maybe\\nIt doesn’t matter. One certain thing is\\nthat the West Virginia primary, on the\\nCatholic Issue, meant a lot to John F.\\nKennedy, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, jr.,\\ngave him a big assist on that occasion.\\nThe nomination to the Commerce\\npost, after much scanning of other\\npossibilities, Is, of course, a political pay\\noff. But what’s so wrong with that?\\nPolitical debts are paid by Republicans\\nas well as Democrats, and the partisan\\nalarms which are being raised over Mr.\\nRoosevelt’s traffic record, his limited\\nbusiness experience and his service as\\nlegal adviser to Trujillo’s Dominican\\nRepublic leave us singularly undis\\nturbed. Mr. Kennedy owed a debt to\\nMr. Roosevelt; he has tried to pay it,\\nand we do not think the Senate will\\nupset this particular political applecart.\\nThere Is one aspect of this matter,\\nhowever, which Is a bit hard to swallow.\\nDuring the West Virginia primary, Mr.\\nRoosevelt, In effect, questioned the pa\\ntriotism of Senator Hubert Humphrey,\\nwho was running as Mr. Kennedy’s\\nProtestant Democratic opponent This\\nwas baseless, and Senator Humphrey,\\nwith ample justification, called It “gutter\\npolitics.” Mr. Kennedy, who might have\\nrepudiated this shabby support, managed\\nto look the other way. He said Mr.\\nRoosevelt was making his speeches, and\\nthat he, Mr. Kennedy, was making his\\nown.\\nAt this late stage of the game it\\ndoesn’t matter much. Mr. Humphrey was\\nbeaten In West Virginia and evidently\\nhas forgiven or forgotten. Mr. Kennedy\\nwent on to win the nomination and the\\nelection. The Republicans are making\\npartisan noises about It, but the political\\ndebt to Mr. Roosevelt Is being paid. As\\nfor the rest of us, like It or not, this Is\\nthe way of politics In our country.\\nNew Bid on Old Dream\\nThe revolutionary government of\\nIraq, In office less than six weeks, is\\nmaking an energetic effort to maintain\\nthe present momentum of political\\nchange In the Arab Middle East. To\\nthis end. Its latest proposal foresees a\\nnew Arab union to be built first around\\na joint three-nation military command\\n—lraq, Syria and the United Arab\\nRepublic—but expanding later to politi\\ncal affairs and to the Inclusion of such\\nother Arab states as Algeria and Yemen.\\nIn one form or another, federation\\nof some or all of the Arab countries Is\\nan old dream that never has been\\nbrought successfully to life. The pros\\npects for the present Iraqi formula, which\\napparently has not even been worked\\nout in any detail, are not noticeably\\nbrighter. After all, the problem of In\\ntegrating sovereign authorities In the\\nfields of military, political or economic\\nplanning are as intricate in the Middle\\nlast as In any other part of the world\\n—possibly more so.\\nIn more ways than one, the key\\nfigure In the plan being promoted by\\nthe Baghdad government Is President\\nNasser of the U. A. R. It was evident\\nduring the brief Iraqul revolution last\\nmonth, and the even faster overthrow\\nof the Syrian government last week,\\nChat the winning forces In each case are\\nadmirers of the Egyptian chief of gov\\nernment. There also was evidence of a\\nsimilar man-ln-the-street attitude both\\nin Baghdad and Damascus. And while\\nIraq and, to a lesser extent, Syria are\\npossessed of greater natural resources\\nthan Egypt, the latter country has the\\npolitical stability and the technological\\nabilities that are essential to any ef\\nfective new experiment In federation.\\nAt the moment, President Nasser\\nIs reported cautiously receptive to the\\nIraqi plan—pending the possibility of\\na “summit meeting\" with the heads of\\ngovernments In Baghdad and Damascus.\\nIt seems clear enough that none of this\\nwill happen In haste, and that the new\\nregimes In Iraq and Syria will have both\\nthe opportunity and the responsibility\\nto demonstrate their qualifications to\\ngovern their own countries before becom\\ning a part of a wider regional authority.\\nNo Time to Quit\\nRepresentative McMillan’s charge\\nthat the “news media” In Washington\\nhave wrecked the prospects of a mean\\ningful Increase In the Federal payment\\nto the District by too much talk about\\nthe President\\'s proposed Federal pay\\nment “formula” Is utter nonsense.\\nOs course the “news media” have\\nbeen enthusiastic about the presidential\\nproposal. It represents, first of all, an\\nadministration concern with the prob\\nlems of the Nation’s Capital that Is\\nvrtually unprecedented. It seeks, sec\\nondly, a permanent, long-range legisla\\ntive solution to the Federal payment\\ndilemma which Is urgently needed to\\nrestore some degree of sanity to the\\nfiscal affairs of the District. And,\\nthirdly, It comes closer In dollar volume\\nto the real needs of the city than the\\nless complex and somewhat smaller\\nIncrease proposed by Mr. McMillan.\\nThis does not mean, of course, that\\nthe White House has spoken the last\\nword, and we are surprised that Mr.\\nMcMillan seems to think the press is\\nso naive as to believe that Is the case.\\nFor his part, Chairman McMillan has\\nserious misgivings about the political\\nfeasibility of the President\\'s bill. Per\\nhaps he will be proved right—and The\\nStar has so stated in the past. But\\nthere obviously Is a sharp difference\\nof opinion on this question between\\nresponsible members of Congress, which\\nlogically and sensibly should be con\\nsidered and resolved In the kind of\\nJoint House-Senate deliberations which\\nhave been proposed by Chairman Bible\\nof the Senate District Committee.\\nIn his letter to a local radio station,\\nMr. McMillan complains that he receives\\nno “assistance or encouragement” from\\nthe “news media” In his legislative ef\\nforts on the District’s behalf. Well, as\\nto that, a number of points might be\\nraised, Including the fact that except\\non rare occasions Chairman McMillan\\nmakes himself totally unavailable to\\nreporters. Under the circumstances, It\\nis hardly strange that the position of\\nthe congressman is not always fully\\nunderstood.\\nBut what has all this to do with the\\nfate of the Federal payment proposals?\\nIn our opinion, Congress will be very\\nlittle Influenced In what It ultimately\\ndoes by the reaction of “news media”\\nto the White House plan. What Chair\\nman McMillan does, however, will be\\nvitally Important, and his current gen\\neralized Irritation at the “news media”\\nis no Justification for a retreat from\\nhis original position that a Federal\\nprogram of substantial proportions is\\nessential to the well-being of the city.\\n\\'lnclude Us Out 1\\nOne of the shoddy, time-worn\\ntraditions which discredit the Maryland\\nLegislature Is a practice that usually\\npermits delegations to “exempt” their\\nlocal areas from the effects of State\\nlegislation distasteful to them. “Include\\nus out,” they say, and voila!—it is\\nmiraculously done. During the prelimi\\nnary voting on the Governor’s\\nmachine bill the other day, however, this\\nunwritten rule suffered one of Its rare\\nsetbacks. It would be pleasant to report\\nthat this resulted from a sudden surge\\nof moral principle. But that, alas, was\\nhardly the case.\\nAs a practical proposition, the bill\\nto abolish slot machines Is aimed only\\nat those four Southern Maryland coun\\nties where the one-armed bandits now\\nare legal. When an amendment was\\nIntroduced to “exempt” three of these\\nfour counties from the effects of the\\nbill, therefore, the Legislature faced a\\nchoice which must have pained some of\\nits elder statesmen. For a vote against\\nthe amendment would strike at least\\nindirectly at the so-called “local option”\\ntradition, raising for some, no doubt, the\\nspecter of later reprisals by the “victims”\\nIn this case. If the amendment were\\npermitted to carry, however, the Legisla\\nture and Its leaders would have been In\\nthe utterly ludicrous position of passing\\na high-priority reform measure which\\nwould have applied to hardly anyone.\\nThe Legislature made the only sen\\nsible choice—rejecting the amendment\\nby the lopsided vote of 93 to 29. Indeed,\\nthe only surprise was that a number of\\nDelegates from outside the affected\\nareas (Including, unaccountably, two\\nfrom Montgomery County) voted the\\nother way. As a precedent, however, the\\nvote was no test at all of sentiment on\\nthe “privilege” of exemption. One can\\nonly hope that on some future occasion\\nthis Issue will be faced on Its merits, and\\nthat eventually “laws of the State” will\\nhave equal application everywhere In\\nMaryland.-\\nGood Samaritan\\nNancy Leudlcke could not under\\nstand what all the fuss was about. All\\nshe had done was to give up one of\\nher healthy kidneys so that George\\nBrost, 39, might have a chance to live\\nfor his nine children. To Mrs. Leudlcke,\\n29, It was a quite natural thing to do.\\nShe just happened to read about Mr.\\nBrest\\'s condition one day while on a\\ncoffee break In Milwaukee. It made no\\ndifference to her that he was a stranger\\nin Boston, and It made no difference\\nthat her own life might be shortened\\nby a long-shot gamble that Mr. Brost\\nwould live.

We fa\\nvor revision of the present\\nlaw to correct this situa\\ntion.”\\nThe county council now\\nhas an opportunity to take\\nthree simple actions which\\nwould go a long way towards\\ncarrying out this pledge.\\nUrgency to act now stems\\nfrom a bill which has been\\nintroduced in the Maryland\\nGeneral Assembly by Sena\\ntor Clark of Howard County.\\nSenator Clark would drop\\nthe present requirement of\\nthe preferential farm assess\\nment act that the \"zoning\\napplicable to the land\" be one\\nof the criteria used to deter\\nmine whether or not land in\\nagricultural use shall be eli\\ngible to be assessed at a small\\nfraction of its market value\\nfor the stated public purpose\\nof maintaining agriculture\\nand preserving open space.\\nYet the zoning criteria is the\\nonly one of 29 in effect which\\ngives any permanence to ag\\nriculture, or acts to preserve\\nopen space.\\nBy a small oversight no\\none ever specified what zon\\ning lot size should qualify the\\nland for preferential assess\\nment. It\\'s right here that the\\npublic purpose of the law to\\npreserve open space has bro\\nken down. Meanwhile farm\\ners who ardently supported\\npreferential assessment on\\nthe grounds that they not be\\ndriven from their land by\\nhigh taxes due to rising land\\nvalues have bitterly opposed\\nagricultural or low density\\nzoning on the grounds that It\\nwould prevent them from\\nsubdividing their farms into\\nhalf-acre lots.\\nWhat the council could\\neasily do is this: First: Go on\\nrecord against Senator\\nClark\\'s amendment. Second:\\nRequest that the Montgom\\nery County Planning Board\\nmake a recommendation to\\nthe county’s legislative dele\\ngation on the proposal of the\\nplanning commission’s staff\\nthat the farm law be amend\\ned to require rural or large\\nlot zoning in addition to ag\\nricultural use, for eligibility\\nto receive preferential assess\\nment. If nothing is done this\\nsession, the chance will not\\ncome again for two years.\\nThird: Declare it to be coun\\ncil policy that since the in\\ntent of the preferential farm\\nassessment act is to main\\ntain agriculture and to pre\\nserve open space as an amen\\nity necessary to human wel\\nfare and happiness, that\\nlandowners who have been\\nreceiving special tax benefits\\ncannot validly object that\\nthe development value or\\ntheir property has been arbi\\ntrarily or unfairly reduced if\\nthe council decides to adopt\\nand implement a general\\nplan requiring that some\\nparts of the county now zoned\\nfor half-acre lots be rezoned\\nfor less Intense residential use\\ncompatible with continued\\nagriculture and providing one\\ntype of needed open space.\\nHarold A.

By C. E. Lucas\\nPhillips. Maps and dia\\ngrams by Audrey Frew,\\nphotographs, 434 PP (At\\nlantic-Little, Brown & Co.;\\n>3.95.)\\nOn the eve of the Battle of\\nAlameln, the then Lieu\\ntenant-General Montgomery\\nIssued a message that ended:\\n\"Let every officer and man\\nenter the battle with a stout\\nheart, and with the determi\\nnation to do his duty so long\\nas he has breath In his body.\\n\"And let no man surrender\\nso long as he is unwounded\\nand can fight.\\n“Let us all pray that ‘the\\nLord Mighty in battle’ will\\ngive us the victory.”\\nThe engagement began on\\nthe night of October 23, 1942.\\nTwelve days later, “the\\nbreakout had been accom\\nplished and the hunt was on.\"\\nThis desert victory over\\nMarshal Rommel and the\\nfamed German Afrlka Corps\\nbegan the final destruction\\nof Axis power In North Af\\nrica.\\nThe tremendous fight is\\nthe subject of an exhaustive\\nand somewhat technical book\\nby C. E. Luca* Phillips, \"who\\nwas commander of one of\\nMontgomery’s regiments” at\\nAlameln and ended the war\\nas a Brigadier General.\\nCertain aspects of the Bat\\ntle of Alameln have inspired\\ntechnical controversy, and\\nBrigadier Phillips has strong\\nnotions of his own. These\\nneed hardly concern the lay\\nman, except perhaps for the\\ndiscussion of the “Rommel\\nlegend.”\\nAS BRIGADIER PHILLIPS\\nsees it, Rommel was simply\\nnot that good. “I have taken\\noccasion,” he writes \"... to ■\\nreduce to its proper propor\\ntions the legendary and whol\\nly exaggerated image of\\nField-Marshal Rommel. One\\nof the foundations of Mont\\ngomery’s victory was his\\nshrewd and exact apprecia\\ntion of the mistakes that he .\\nknew Rommel would make.”\\n\"Alameln” begins with a\\nvivid description of military\\nlife on the desert and a brief\\nsurvey of previous military\\nactivity there. We are then\\nled through a list of the\\nunits involved and elaborate\\ndisquisitions on some tech\\nnical problems. Indeed, by\\nthe time he has finished the\\nfirst part of the book, the\\nreader should be able to\\ngather up some friends and\\ngo out to clear a minefield.\\nThen, the main subject. At\\nAlameln, Montgomery\\nchanged the nature of desert\\nwarfare. Instead of employ\\ning lightning tank stabs\\nagainst prepared positions,\\nhe began with an old-fash\\nioned artillery barrage. The\\nfirst waves of Infantry fol\\nlowed the barrage as it began\\nto roll forward. Only then\\ndid sappers clear paths\\nthrough the minefields for\\nthe tanks and self-propelled\\nguns.\\nIn this way, Montgomery\\ngot anti-tank guns into for\\nward positions and proved\\n\"that tanks . . . could no\\nmore advance in the face of\\nresolutely manned anti-tank\\nguns than the cavalry of\\ntheir fathers’ day could ad-\\nclear that a multilateral\\nforce in which the United\\nStates retains a right of veto\\narouses very limited interest\\nThe reason why these\\nschemes have been doomed\\nfrom the beginning is that\\nthey all have overlooked one\\nsimple central ■ fact about\\nemergent Europe: That it in\\ntends to become in its own\\nright without any qualifica\\ntion one of the world’s great\\npowers.\\nThis will be true whoever\\ncalls the tune. It is not, aa\\nmany Americans have been\\nwrongly led to believe, an\\nabberatlon peculiar to Gen.\\nde Gaulle. It is, in fact, pre\\ncisely because he gives a spe\\ncial and eloquent expression\\nto this almost universal idea\\nthat the general stands head\\nand shoulders above every\\nother European leader today.\\nFor Independence\\nEurope, then, will not ul\\ntimately allow its potential\\npower to be circumscribed or\\ncontrolled by the United\\nStates in the name of “West\\nern solidarity” or \"interde\\npendence.” It will not, in any\\njoint effort, accept the propo\\nsition of a junior partner.\\nIt will not be diverted by\\nschemes designed to per\\npetuate the dependence of\\nEurope on American power.\\nWhat Europe is heading for\\nand what it will most cer\\ntainly one day achieve is a\\nreal alliance of equal part\\nners with the United States.\\nUnless the United States can\\naccept this goal in every\\nsphere of international ac\\ntivity. it will find itself in\\ncreasingly at cross purposes\\nwith strongly - developing\\ntrends in this part of the\\nworld.\\nUntil these basic facts are\\nassimilated in Washington, it\\nwill be impossible to develop\\npolicies toward Europe that\\nstand much chance of suc\\ncess. There are occasions\\nwhen the necessity of making\\na public statement by an\\nimportant official has led to\\nclarification of policy itself.\\nIf the forthcoming visits\\ncould produce such a result,\\nit would be gratefully re\\nceived in both Europe and\\nthe United States.\\nvance in the face of quick\\nfiring field artillery.”\\nRommel fulled to appreci\\nate the point. Again and\\nagain he mounted counter\\nattacks led by tanks. The\\nlosses he thereby sustained\\nbegan the destruction of his\\narmy.\\nALAMEIN WAS A HARD,\\nbloody fight and Brigadier\\nPhillips follows it in great\\ndetail, sometimes down to\\ncompany and even platoon\\nlevel. His style is curiously\\nchangeable. Sometimes it\\nborders on eloquence; some\\ntimes It comes uncomfort\\nably close to “sick” parody.\\nMost American readers will\\nhave trouble with the rich\\nassortment of British mili\\ntary abbreviations, for while\\nthe glossary Informs us that\\na FOO Is a \"Forward Obser\\nvation Officer (artillery),”\\nwe are left to dredge “VC”\\n(Victoria Cross) out of our\\nmemories and such things as\\n“RTR (Royal Tank Regi\\nment) out of the index.\\nThese are small faults\\ncompared to the book’s many\\nvirtues. Its maps and tacti\\ncal descriptions are clear, as\\nindeed they should be since\\nBrigadier Phillips has, made\\nconsiderable use not only of\\nthe usual sources but also\\nof unpublished diaries and\\nhas asked innumerable par\\nticipants to search their\\nmemories.\\n\"Alameln” is a bloody vol\\nume.

The fact that the\\nFounding Fathers believed de\\nvotedly that there was a God\\nand that the unalienable\\nrights of man were rooted in\\nhim is clearly evidenced in\\ntheir writings, from the May\\nflower Compact to the Consti\\ntution itself.\\nEvidence in Public Life\\nThis background is evidenced\\ntoday in our public life through\\nthe continuance in our oaths of\\noffice from the presidency to\\nthe alderman of the final sup\\nplication, “so help me God.”\\nLikewise each House of the\\nCongress provides through Its\\nchaplain an opening prayer,\\nand the sessions of this court\\nare declared open by the crier\\nIn a short ceremony, the final\\nphrase of which Invokes the\\ngrace of God.\\nAgain, there are such mani\\nfestations in our military forces,\\nwhere those of our citizens who\\nare under the restrictions trf ,\\nmilitary service wish to engage\\ntn voluntary worship.

Today au- \\'\\nthoritiea list S 3 separate religi- 1\\nous bodies, each with member- <\\n, ships exceeding 50,000, exist\\nj ing among our people, as well I\\nas Innumerable smaller groups i\\n...This court has decisively \\'\\n; settled that the First Amend-\\n’ will provide a guide in discon\\ntinuing publie school religious\\nrituals and observances. For\\nthe people, the decisions should i\\n. be a reminder of our duty to\\ni provide for our children a gen- :\\nuine and meaningful religious :\\neducation and to make our\\nhomes and churches and syna- 1\\npogues true citadels of deep and\\nchallenging religious faith.” 1\\nBishop John Wesley Lord of <\\nthe Methodist Church, resident i\\nin the Washington area, said <\\nthe decision may, in the long i\\nrun, “moot truly conserve the i\\nChristian values that lie at the l\\nheart of our Christian faith i\\nand of our American democ\\nracy.” i\\nHe said that although the\\nruling may result “in some loh i\\nin the schools,” the loss “can i\\nbe and must be compensated i\\nfor by the recognition that the i\\nprimary responsibility for roll- I\\ngious training ruts with the .\\nhome and the church.” (\\nBy relegating traditional roll- i\\ngious training “to a secular i\\nagency,” Blahop Lord Hid. “we i\\nINTERPtfTIVE REPORT\\nDoe* the State action advance\\nor inhibit religion? if it does\\neither, he continued, then it\\nexceeds the extent of Govern\\nment Involvement permitted by\\nth* Founders.\\nTh* court, in a separate ac\\ntion. returned to Florida courts\\na Miami school ease in which\\nthe highest State court had up\\nheld Masonal hymn singing,\\nbaccalaureate services and art\\num of religious symbols\\nWhether these, and other\\nactivities, meet or violate con\\nstitutional standard* will prob\\nably be presented to the high\\ncourt in the future for decision.\\nThe uncertainty, meanwhile,\\nmay eauM problems.\\nWhile yesterday\\'s decision\\ndealt with Government re\\nquired devotional exercises,\\nthere appeared to be little—if\\nany—roem under the opinions\\nfor teacher* to plan such exer\\ncises themselves.\\nAgents of State\\nThe teachers, as government\\nemploye* operaUng in govern\\nment-owned facilities on gov\\nernment time, probably could\\nbe considered as agents of the\\nState. Thu*, they probably\\nwould be bound by the same\\nstandards.\\nOne major area was covered\\nby th* court in yesterday\\'s\\nopinion. Justice Clark made it\\nclear that ths First Amend\\nment does not bar study of the\\nBible or religion as part of va\\nrious secular subjects.\\n\"It might well be Mid that\\none\\'s education is not complete\\nment’s mandate thafCongrem\\nshall make no law respecting\\nan establishment of religion, or\\nprohibiting the free exercise\\nthereof\" has been made wholly\\ni applicable to the States by the\\n114th Amendment.\\n! Second, this court has re\\nlooted unequivocally the con\\ntention that the establishment\\nclause forbids only govern\\n’ mental preference of one rell\\n, gion over another. Almoat 30\\nyears ago in Everson, supra, at\\n, 11, the court said that “neither\\n: a State nor the Federal Gov\\nernment can Mt up a church.\\nNeither can pom laws which\\n\\' aid one religion, aid all re\\n. llgions, or prefer one religion\\n‘ over another.” . . .\\nt While none of the parties of\\n, these cases has questioned\\n, these basic conclusions of the\\n, court, both of which have been\\n> long established, recognized\\n! and consistently leaffairmed,\\nothers continue to question\\n( their history, logic and efficacy.\\nSuch contentions, in the light\\n, of the consistent interpretation\\n, in cases of thia court, seem\\nentirely untenable and of value\\nonly as academic exercises.\\n. . . Ths wholesome \"neu\\ntrality” of which this court’s\\ncases speak thus stems from a\\nrecognition of the teachings of\\nhistory that powerful sects or\\ngroups might bring about a\\nfusion of governmental and\\nreligious functions or a con\\ncept or dependency of one\\nupon the other to the end\\nthat official support of the\\nState or Federal Government\\nwould be placed behind the .\\ntenets of one or of all ortho- ,\\ndoxies. This the establishment -\\nclause prohibits.\\nAnd a further reason for .\\nneutrality is found In the free t\\nexercise clause, which recog- ,\\nnizes the value of religious ,\\ntraining, teaching and observ- .\\nance and, more particularly,\\nthe right of every person to\\nfreely choom his own course \\'\\nwith reference thereto, free of\\nany compulsion from the State.\\nThis the free exercim clause\\nguarantees.\\nThus, as we have seen, the\\ntwo clauses may overlap. As\\nwe have Indicated, the estab\\nlishment clauM has been di\\nrectly considered by this court\\neight times in the past score of 1\\nyears and, with only one jus- 1\\ntice dissenting on the point, 1\\nit has consistently held that 1\\nthe clause withdrew all leg\\'s- I\\nlative power respecting rellgous i\\nbelief or the expression thereof, i\\nl\\nPurpose and Effeet\\nThe test may be stated as i\\nfollows: What is the purpose i\\nand the primary effect of the >\\nenactment? If either is the 1\\nadvancement or inhibition of 1\\nreligion then the enactment\\nexceeds the scope of legislative <\\npower as circumscribed by the\\nConstitution. i\\nThat is to say that to with- ’\\nstand the strictures of the i\\nestablishment clause there must i\\nbe a secular legislative pur- i\\npose and a primary effeet that\\nI\\nincur the risk of placing the (\\nwhole tradition in jeopardy.”\\nThe Right Rev. William F. i\\nCreighton. Episcopal bishop of 1\\nWashington, said the court’s \\'\\nruling \"may well be a gain ,\\nrather than a loss,” and added: (\\n\"It throws the responsibility I\\nfor nurture in faith and for the 1\\ninculcation of faith directly 1\\nback upon our churches and\\no>ir families. The question has (\\nalready been raised in our dlo- (\\ncese as to whether a family j\\nthat observes no time of oom- j\\nmon prayer or Bible reading in (\\nits own life has any basis for i\\ncomplaining of the omission of (\\nthem practices in the public i\\nschools ”\\nBishop Creighton declared i\\nthat the court’s ruling that the ]\\nstudy of religion, “when pre\\nsented objectively as part of a I\\nsecular program of education,” |\\nis consistent with the First 1\\nAmendment, “clearly opens the i\\ndoor tor an increased emphasis (\\nupon our religious heritage as I\\na regular part of the public I\\nschool curriculum.\" i\\nwithout a study of comparative\\nreligion or the history of re\\nligion and its relationship to\\nthe advancement of civilisa\\ntion,” he said.\\nThe use of the Bible or\\nLord\\'s Prayer in dally opening\\nexercise*. Justice Clark said,\\nwas a different thing. Because\\nthere were religious exercises,\\nhe said, they could not stand\\nunder ths Constitution,\\nEstablishment Clause\\nIt was the Establishment\\nClause rather than the Free\\nExercise Clause of the First\\nAmendment that figured In\\nyesterday\\'* case*. This is the\\n■ection which bar* State* from\\nadvancing or Inhibiting reli\\ngion.\\nJustice Brennan. In a 77*\\npage concurring opinion, went\\nbeyond the majority opinion\\ndelivered by Justice Clark to\\ndiscuss other area* of church\\nstate relations where ques\\ntions might be raised.\\nIn both opinions—as well as\\nin other opinions in th* Bible\\nand Lord’s Prayer case* de\\ncided yesterday—the Justices\\nseemed to be trying to avoid\\nbeing misinterpreted a* strik\\ning down other types of prac\\ntices.\\nLast spring, when the\\ntribunal struck down New\\nYork’s 22-word ‘‘official”\\nschool prayer written by State\\neducator*, the court was criti\\ncised on the mistaken ground\\nit had attacked religion gen\\nerally.\\nIt wu along this line of!\\ni neither advances nor inhibits\\nI religion.\\nThe tree exercise clause, like\\ni wise considered many times\\n> hero, withdraws from leglsla\\ni tive power, State and Federal,\\nthe exertion of any restraint on\\nthe free exercise of religion.\\nIts purpoM is to secure rollg\\ni lous liberty in the individual by\\n■ prohibiting any invasions\\nthereof by civil authority.\\n1 Hence it 1s neoessary in a free\\n1 exercise case for one to show\\n\\' the coercive effect of the enact\\nment as it operates against him\\n■ in the practice of his religion.\\n1 The distinction between the\\ntwo clauses Is apparent—a vlo\\n-1 latlon of the free exercise\\nclauM is predicted on coercion\\n\\' while the establishment clause\\nviolation need not be so\\ni attended.\\nI\\nPrescribed Exercises\\nApplying the establishment\\nclause principles to the cases at\\nbar we find that the States\\nare requiring the selection and\\nreading at the opening of the\\nschool day of versea from the\\nHoly Bible and the recitation\\nof the Lord\\'s Frayer by ths stu\\ndents in unison.\\nThese exercises are prescribed\\nas part of the curricular ac\\ntivities of students who are re\\nquired by law to attend school.\\nThey are held in the school\\nbuildings under the supervision\\nand with the participation of\\nteachers employed in those\\nschools. . . .\\nTrial court . . . has found\\nthat such an opening exercise\\nis a religious ceremony and was\\nintended by the State to be so.\\nWe agree with the trial court\\'s\\nfinding is to the religious char\\nacter of the exercises. Given\\nthat finding the exercises and\\nthe law requiring them are in\\nviolation of the establishment\\nclause.\\nThere is no such specific find\\ning as to the religious character\\nof the exercises in (the second\\ncase) that the program is an\\neffort to extend Ito benefits to\\nall public school children with\\nout regard to their religious\\nbelief. ...\\nInstrament of Religion\\nBut even if Its purpoH Is not\\nstrictly religious, it is sought\\nto be accomplished through\\nreadings, without comment,\\nfrom the Bible. Surely the\\nplace of the Bible as an instru\\nment of religion cannot be\\ngainsaid, and the State’s rec\\nognition of the pervading re\\nligious character of the cere\\nmony is evident from the rule’s\\nspecific permission of the alter\\nnative use of the Catholic\\nDouay version as well as the\\nrecent amendment permitting\\nnon-attendance at the exer\\ncises.\\nNone of these factors is con\\nsistent with the contention that 1\\nthe Bible is here used either <\\nas an instrument for non\\nreligious moral inspiration or\\nas a reference for the teach\\ning of secular subjects. |\\nThe conclusion follows that\\nin both cases the laws require\\nreligious exercises and such ex- :\\nereises are being conducted in I\\ndirect violation of the righto of i\\nthe appellees and petitioners, i\\nNor are these required exer\\ncises mitigated by the fact that i\\nindividual students may absent 1\\nthemselves upon parental re- 1\\nquest, for that fact furnishes I\\nno defense to a claim of un- ’\\nconstitutionality under the m- \\'\\ntabliahment clause.\\nCould Become Torrent\\n. . . Further, it is no defense !\\nto urge that the religious prac\\ntices here may be relatively\\nminor encroachments on the\\nFirst Amendment. The breach\\nof neutrality that la today a\\ntrickling stream may all too\\nsoon become a raging torrent\\nand. in the words of Madison,\\n\"it is proper to take alarm at\\nthe first experiment on our\\nliberties.” . . .\\nIt is insisted that unless\\nthese religious exercises are\\npermitted a “religion of secu\\nlarism” Is established In the\\nschools.

In addition, it\\nmight well ba said that one’s\\neducation la not complete .with\\nout a study of comparative re\\nligion or the history of religion\\nand Ito relationship to the ad\\nvancement of civilization. It\\ncertainly may be said that the\\nBible Is worthy of study for Ito\\nliterary and historic qualities.\\nStudy Approved\\nNothing we have said here\\nindicates that such study of\\nthe Bible or of religion when\\npromoted objectively as part of\\na secular program of educa\\ntion, may not be effected con\\nsistent with the First Amend\\nment. But the exercises here\\ndo not fall into thorn categories.\\nThey are religious exercises,\\nrequired by the States in viola\\ntion of the command of the\\nFirst Amendment that the Gov\\nernment maintain strict neu\\ntrality, neither aiding nor op\\nposing religion.\\nFinally, we cannot accept\\nthat the concept of neutrality\\nwhich does not permit a State\\nto require a religious exercise\\neven with the consent of the\\nmajority of those affected, col\\nlides with the majority’s right\\nto free exercim of religion.\\nWhile the free exercise clause\\nclearly prohibit* the urn of\\nState action to deny the rights\\nof free exercim to anyone, it\\nhas never meant that a ma\\njority could use the machinery\\nof the State to practice be\\nliefs. . . .\\nThe place of religion in our\\nsociety is an exalted one,\\nachieved through a long tra\\ndition of reliance on the home,\\nthe church and the Inviolable\\ncitadel of the individual heart\\nand mind.\\nWe have come to recognise\\nthrough bitter experience that\\nit is not within the power of\\ngovernment to Invade the cit\\nadel, whether it* purpose or\\neffect be to aid or oppose, to\\nadvance or retard.\\nIn the relationship between\\nman and religion, the State la\\nfirmly committed to a petition\\nof neutrality.

He won the State Golden\\nGloves bantamweight title when\\nhe was 15 and repeated the next\\nyear. Later he made money by\\nfighting a few bouts as a profes\\nsional in the old “smokers” that\\nentertained small towns.\\nWhen he went to the Univer\\nsity of Alabama In 1937, he was\\nalmost penniless. His father died\\na few months later, and his moth\\ner went to work as a sewing su\\npervisor to help make their way.\\nWallace waited on tables at a\\nboarding house for students,\\nworked as a clerk in the regis\\ntrar’s office and drove a cab to\\nwork his way through college.\\nWhen he graduated from the\\nuniversity law school In 1942, he\\ntook a temporary Job driving a\\ndump truck from the State High\\nway Department at 30 cents an\\nhour. He began to make frequent\\nvisits to a dime store in Tusca\\nloosa to see a pretty clerk named\\nLurleen Burns, then a 16-year\\nold high school graduate hoping\\nto become a nurse. They were\\nmarried in May of 1943.\\nBy that time Wallace was a\\ncadet in the Army Air Corps. His\\nhopes for becoming a pilot van\\nished when he was stricken with\\nspinal meningitis, which left him\\ncritically ill. When he recovered\\nhe became a flight engineer and\\nwent to the Marianas with a B\\n-29 group assigned to raid the\\nJapanese mainland.\\nAfter his discharge as a flight\\ncope with State laws or practices\\ncountenancing racial discrimina\\ntion. The administration report\\nedly favors working through the\\ninterstate commerce clause of\\nthe Constitution. The Republi\\ncans would rely directly on the\\nFourteenth Amendment “to pro\\nvide the minimum tools to aid\\nthe Negro in his valiant crusade\\nfor equality throughout the Na\\ntion.”\\nEven before the Civil War end\\ned in 1865 other kinds of differ\\nences were developing not only\\non how to handle the Southern\\nStates which had seceded but\\nalso how to safeguard the rights\\nof the Negro.\\nAfter Lincoln\\nPresident Lincoln’s general idea\\nof an executive program for post\\nwar reconstruction was taken up\\nby President Johnson. A group\\nof House and Senate Republicans,\\nled by Representative Thaddeus\\nStevens of Pennsylvania and sub\\nsequently to be called “Radicals,”\\nwanted to approach the problem\\nfrom the congressional angle.\\nThey not only intended to deal\\nin their own way with the South\\nern States but also complained\\nthat the Lincoln-Johnson ap\\nproach would not assure voting\\nprivileges and even more basic\\ncivil rights and protections for\\nNegroes.\\nThe “Radicals” as well as more\\nmoderate members of Congress\\nnoted with indignation or suspi\\ncion the so-called “Black Code”\\nlaws which many of the South\\nern States began enacting imme\\ndiately after the war.\\nMainly through the efforts of a\\nsergeant, Wallace saw his family\\nand then hitchhiked to Mont\\ngomery. He had connections with\\nGov. Chauncey Sparks and went to\\nsee him about a job. He became\\nan assistant attorney general of\\nAlabama.\\nIn 1946 he won a seat as a\\nState Representative from his\\nhome county. His slx-year career\\nas a legislator wort him State\\nwide attention. He championed\\nbills creating a Statewide network\\nof trade schools, setting up ma\\nchinery for bringing In new In\\ndustry and enabling small com\\nmunities to establish natural gas\\nco-operatives when they could not\\nobtain service from private firms.\\nBut there was not much drama\\nin this.\\nWas a State Judge\\n\\'That came after he became a\\nState circuit Judge for Barbour\\nand Bullock Counties in 1952. He\\nbegan to-preach from the bench\\nagainst the Federal Government.\\nIn 1953 he won a brief flurry of\\nattention by issuing an injunc\\ntion against removal of segrega\\ntion signs in railroad terminals.\\nHis biggest tilt with the Fed\\nerate came when he refused to\\nmake voting records available to\\nGovernment investigators and was\\ncited for contempt of Federal\\ncourt. What followed is still a\\nsubject of hot debate in Alabama.\\nUnited States District Judge\\nFrank Johnson, who had been\\nWallace’s university roommate,\\neventually held that Judge Wal\\nlace had not been In contempt\\nbecause he actually had made the\\nvoter records available to the\\nagents “through devious methods.”\\nThat decision was in early 1959.\\nBy then Wallace had run for\\nGovernor the first time, finishing\\na strong second to John Patter\\nson.\\nWhen he ran again last year,\\nhis opponents threw Judge John\\nson’s decision at him with glee,\\ncharging hypocrisy. But Wallace\\nalways denied he had helped the\\nFederal agents. He said they “were\\ndefied and backed down.”\\nTn a runoff campaign, he de\\nfeated a young moderate. State\\nSenator Ryan deGraffenried, by a\\nJoint Committee on Reconstruc\\ntion, Congress passed a series of\\nbills beginning early in 1866. One\\nof these, the Freedmen’s Bureau\\nAct, included civil rights of Ne\\ngroes under the Federal military\\njurisdiction in those States. Pres\\nident Johnson vetoed the bill and\\nwas upheld in Congress.\\nNegroes os Citizens\\nBut Congress soon overrode a\\npresidential veto of a civil rights\\nbill in April, 1866. That measure\\nprovided that all persons bom in\\nthe United States were citizens.\\nIt thus reversed the Supreme\\nCourt’s Dred Scott decision, that\\nNegroes could not hold citizen\\nship. The bill also contained far\\nreaching provisions giving Ne\\ngroes much the same legal and\\npolitical rights as whites.\\nSo many doubts were raised\\nabout constitutionality of the\\n1866 civil rights law that the\\n“Radicals\"—who actually includ\\ned some legislators much more\\nmoderate than Mr. Stevens—be\\ngan formulating possible consti\\ntutional amendment proposals.\\nMr. Stevens and Representative\\nRoscoe Conkling of New York in\\ntroduced a constitutional amend\\nment resolution early in 1866 to\\ncut House representation of any\\nState in proportion to the\\nabridgement of any person\\'s po\\nlitical rights in that State. Rep\\nresentatives Blaine of Maine and\\nGarfield of Ohio urged Mr. Ste\\nvens to tone down the resolution\\nbut he refused. It was passed by\\nthe House but rejected by the\\nSenate.\\nThe Joint Committee on Re\\nconstruction several months later\\nThe Chief Justice: A Study in Pragmatism\\nBy SAUL PETT\\nAssociated Press SUH Writer\\nFor one brief moment, the Chief\\nJustice of the United States\\nsavored an appetite he could no\\nlong indulge. He was sitting in\\nhis chambers, a tall, white-haired\\nman of quiet dignity. The place\\nwas what you’d expect—a high\\nceilinged room, paneled in oak,\\nlined richly with law books, cush\\nioned in stillness, altogether a se\\nrene Island walled in majestic\\nwhite marble.\\nQuietly, Earl Warren had been\\nexplaining that the Supreme\\nCourt, unlike other branches of\\nGovernment, cannot engage in\\npublic debate or even defend its\\ndecisions from attack.\\nDoes he sometimes wish it were\\notherwise?\\nHis dark blue eyes lighted up\\nand a big hand came down on\\nthe desk, slapping it hard, crack\\ning the decorous quiet.\\n\"Oh boy!\" said the 14th Chief\\nJustice of the United States.\\n\"Sometimes it makes you cringe,\\nto see what other people say and\\nwrite I\"\\nCurtain Is Closed Quickly\\nThere was no doublt that Earl\\nWarren, former district attorney,\\nattorney general and three-time\\nGovernor of California, a man\\nwho had been a politician most\\nof his adult life, would dearly\\nrelish a chance to hit back at\\nhis critics. The statement was\\nmade not so much in bitterness\\nbut in remembered scat, much like\\nan ex-boxer recalling how he\\nwotld have counter - punched in\\nthe old days.\\nBut having parted the curtain\\n5-4 margin. He said at his inaugu\\nration on January 14 that the\\nSouth held the balance of United\\nStates political power and it,\\nrather than “the Insipid bloc voter\\nsections,” would elect the next\\nPresident. He promised “segrega\\ntion now, segregation tomorrow,\\nsegregation forever.”\\nStrong Invective seems away\\nof life for this jaunty, cigar-smok\\ning man. He has called Attorney\\nGeneral Robert F. Kennedy a\\n\"pugnacious wilding” and a “sap\\nling Caesar,\" the Federal courts\\n“lousy” and “irresponsible,” and\\nPresident Kennedy the boss of a\\n\"military dictatorship.”\\nEven his critics grant that Mr.\\nWallace has made some excellent\\nappointments tin his administra\\ntion, with a strong “cleanup” em T\\nphasis that follows the looser\\nways of former Gov. Patterson.\\nCleaned Up Scandals\\nA teetotaler himself, he set out\\nto reform the scandal-tinged State\\nliquor store operation. Economy\\nhas been a strong emphasis: He\\nsold one of the State’s two yachts\\nand put the other on limited duty\\nfor the city of Mobile; he cut\\ndown the fleet of State automo\\nbiles; and he called for a big cut\\nin his own executive department’s\\nbudget.\\nRather than use a chauffeur\\ndriven limousine, he prefers to ride\\nin a police car, sitting alongside\\nthe highway patrolman who\\ndrives.\\nHis racial stand remains the\\nchief target of criticism, some of\\nit from people who supported him\\nfor Governor. They believe most\\nof Alabama’s leadership has\\nturned down another street while\\nWallace has continued to march\\non his collision course with the\\nFederal Government.\\nGov. Wallace has been faced\\nwith a constantly rising tide of\\nopposition on his “school\\nhouse door” pledge. Civic, reli\\ngious and business groups\\nthroughout the State have adopted\\n\"law and order” resolutions, which\\nare considered a warning against\\ndefiance of Federal Integration\\norders.\\ncame up with a more compre\\nhensive amendment resolution\\nwhich, with some changes, even\\ntually became the Fourteenth\\nAmendment It contained a com\\npromise version of the defeated\\nStevens-Conkling bill. But it did\\nnot include suggestions by Ste\\nvens and others for outright Fed\\neral granting of the voting priv\\nilege to Negroes.\\nAn earlier draft of the Four\\nteenth Amendment as proposed\\nby the Joint Committee but later\\nconsiderably modified in Repub\\nlican congressional caucuses\\nstated:\\n“Congress shall have power to\\nmake all laws which shall be\\nnecessary and proper to secure to\\nthe citizens of each State all the\\nprivileges and immunities of citi\\nzens in the several States, and\\nto all persons in the several States\\nequal protection in the rights of\\nlife, liberty and property.”\\n• •\\nRights Protected\\nAs it finally emerged, the\\namendment’s first section pro\\nvided that all persons born or\\nnaturalized in the United States\\nare citizens of the United States\\nand the State in which they live,\\nand also declared:\\n“No State shall make or enforce\\nany law which shall abridge the\\nprivileges or Immunities of citizens\\nof the United States; nor shall\\nany State deprive any person of\\nlife, liberty or property without\\ndue process of law; nor deny to\\nany person within its Jurisdiction\\nthe equal protection of the laws.\"\\nThis, therefore, centered on\\nState obligations and responsi\\nbilities. It applied to States some\\nmomentarily, Earl Warren quickly\\nclosed it and returned to the ivory\\ntower, far above the clang of pub\\nlic battle.\\n“But, of course, we cant,” he\\nsaid. “A Senator or Governor may\\nexplain or defend his position\\npublicly, but not member* of the\\nSupreme Court. We can’t be\\nguided by what people think or\\nsay except in legal discussion. We\\ncan’t be guided by public ap\\npraisal. If we did, we’d be decid\\ning cases by other than legal\\nmeans.”\\nDoes the Chief Justice have any\\nescape valve for his suppressed re\\nactions?\\n“Yes,” he said, smiling. “I go\\nto baseball games and football\\ngames and get rid of some of my\\npartiality that way. Also. I like\\nto get away with my three sons\\nand go fishing or duck-hunting\\nin California.\"\\nA Tenth Anniversary\\nNext September, it will be 10\\nyears since Earl Warren was ap\\npointed Chief Justice by Presi\\ndent Eisenhower Although he is\\nnow 72 and eligible for retirement\\nat full salary (135,000), he has\\nno thought of quitting soom\\nHe continues to enjoy his Job,\\nthe Judge said in a recent rare\\ninterview, despite the fact that\\nhe has been attacked more in\\ntensely than moat of his prede\\ncessors. The criticism, which in\\nsome quarters has risen even to\\nshrill cries for Impeachment, gen\\nerally stemmed from Warren’s\\nopinions ort racial segregation in\\nschools, on the rights of individ\\nuals in anticommunist investiga\\ntions, on the constitutionality of\\nState - written prayers in the\\nclassroom.\\nAsked to descirbe his reaction\\nh 1\\n■ _A T\\n■ -\\nJ* 1 -I \\'3‘“C : \\'\\n—AP Phot#.\\nGOV.

Critics of the Fourteenth\\nAmendment contend that its adop\\ntion was even more tainted be\\ncause ratification was often used\\nas a prerequisite to “readmission”\\nof several Southern States to the\\nUnion.\\nTennessee quickly ratified it\\nand was \"readmitted” in July\\n1866. The other 10 Southern\\nStates rejected the amendment at\\nlegislative sessions later that year.\\nSeveral of them \"reconsidered” in\\n1868. Then, Ohio and New Jersey\\nwithdrew their ratifications. This\\nraised a question as to whether\\nand when 28 of the then 37\\nStates provided the three-fourths\\nmajority necessary for final adop\\ntion.\\nOn July 20, 1868, Secretary of\\nto this kind of attack, Warren\\nreplied quickly and firmly. \"My\\nreaction is that I just don’t dis\\ncuss it.”\\nSlamming doors shut on any\\nsubject, one gathers* does not\\ncome naturally to the Chief Jus\\ntice.

He showed\\nus the large, beautiful conference\\nroom adjoining his own chambers\\nwhere the nine members of the\\ncourt usually meet on Fridays to\\ndiscuss and vote on cases after\\nhaving read all the briefs and\\nheard oral arguments.\\nThese meetings are held in ut\\nmost secrecy.

But usually it\\'s the newest\\nmember.”\\nDoes the discussion in confer\\nence ever warm up to hot de\\nbate?\\n\"You’d be surprised at how little\\nheat there is in our discussions,”\\nsaid the Chief Justice. \"That\\'s be\\ncause we all know what the other\\nState Seward conditionally certi\\nfied that the Fourteenth Amend\\nment had become a part of the\\nConstitution \"if the withdrawals\\nof Ohio and New Jersey were in\\neffective.” On July 21, Georgia\\nratified the amendment as South\\nCarolina had done on July 9. Con\\ngress immediately passed a joint\\nresolution declaring final adoption\\nof the amendment. On July 28,\\n1868, Secretary Seward certified\\nit unconditionally. Several other\\nStates subsequently ratified it.\\nIn any event, the Fourteenth\\nAmendment was revolutionary in\\ndefining citizenship and Federal-\\nState relationships.

For many\\nyears that section resembled the\\nweather, about which many talked\\nbut did nothing.\\nThe NAACP Legal Defense\\nFund recently filed a Federal\\nCourt suit to test that section.\\nThe NAACP estimates that if\\nthe section were strictly enforced\\nman\\'s basic views are and we\\nrespect them. But many times\\nthere is an accommodation that\\ncan be reached.\\n“It is all very informal and\\nthere\\'s very little Irritation shown\\nin conference. We take the cases\\nin the order in which we heard\\nthem. The Chief Justice starts by\\nstating his opinion on the first\\ncase, usually in two or three\\nminutes.\\n“Then the other justices, in or\\nder of seniority, state their in\\ndividual views without interrup\\ntion.

As a result\\nconfusion has been com\\npounded. But that is not to\\nsay that there was a goof in\\noperations, or a “photo gap,”\\nor a jurisdictional fight be\\ntween the CIA and the Air\\nForce, or even that Senator\\nKeating is a prophet.\\nWhat has been wrong with\\nthe administration approach\\nhas been a lack of co-ordina\\ntion. For one thing, it has\\nallowed post-mortem inquiries\\non Cuba to become the prop\\nerty of a gaggle of different\\nCongressional committees—\\nnone of them with clearly\\ndefined terms of reference.\\nThere is Senator Dirksen’s\\none-man Investigation. There\\nis the investigation of the\\nSenate Preparedness Sub\\ncommittee under Senator\\nStennis. There are inquiries\\nby subcommittees of the\\nHouse Foreign Affairs and\\nthe Senate Foreign Relations\\nCommittees. It has been ru\\nmored that Congressman\\nHardy’s Government Opera\\ntions Committee Is consider\\ning the possibility of an in\\nvestigation of the Cuban\\npolicy of the Eisenhower ad\\nministration. The admini\\nstration’s attention to the\\nproblem has been so lax. that\\nit seems not even to have\\ntaken steps to \\' block the\\nappointment of one of its\\nsharpest and most irrespon\\nsible critics—Senator Thur\\nmond of South Carolina—to\\nthe Stennis subcommittee.\\nIt is also becoming clear\\nthat the administration has\\nbeen speaking with several\\nvoices. One of the principal\\nadministration witnesses has\\nbeen the CIA Director, John\\nMcCone, a Republican who\\nDORIS FLEE SON\\n• A Busy Day for Mrs. Johnson\\nHer Activities in West Virginia Today\\nRecall Feats of Eleanor Roosevelt\\nIt must have seemed like\\nold times in West Virginia\\ntoday.\\nA gracious woman from\\nthe highest Washington cir\\ncles flew in and addressed\\nherself to the first fruits of\\nthe Kennedy administration\\neffort to improve economic\\nand social conditions in the\\nareas.\\nMrs. Lyndon Johnson did\\nnot go down a coal mine as\\nEleanor Roosevelt did nearly\\n30 years ago, but her 14-hour\\nd«y was faithful to the pat\\ntern recorded in the most\\nfamous diary ot modem\\ntimes.\\nIt began when she turned\\nthe first shovel of earth for\\nthe new county library in\\nthe suburbs of Charleston, a\\nproject of the Area Redevel\\nopment Administration. Her\\nown large gift of books in\\ncluded—but of course—Pro\\nfiles In Courage, autographed,\\nand others autographed by\\nmen.\\nJustice Stewart, speaking\\nfor the majority of the high\\nest court in the land, said:\\n“The State courts have\\nheld that the petitioners’\\nconduct constituted breach\\nof the peace under State law,\\nand we may accept their de\\ncision as binding upon us to\\nto that extent. But it never\\ntheless remains our duty in a\\ncase such as this to make an\\nindependent examination of\\nthe whole record. And it is\\nclear to us that in arresting,\\nconvicting, and punishing\\nthe petitioners under the cir\\ncumstances disclosed by this\\nrecord, South Carolina in\\nfringed the petitioners’ con\\nstitutionally protected rights\\nof free speech, free assembly,\\nand freedom to petition for\\nredress of their grievances.”\\nThe episode took place on\\nthe grounds of the State\\nHouse while the legislature\\nwas actually in session. Jus\\ntice Clark studied the same\\nrecord and testimony. He\\npointed out that nearly 200\\ndemonstrators marched with\\nplacards bearing slogans\\nsuch as “Down With Segre\\ngation” and \"You May Jail\\nOur Bodies But Not Our\\nSouls.\" and then proceeded\\nto stir up the trouble. He\\nadded:\\n“The activity continued for\\napproximately 45 minutes\\nduring the busy noon-hour\\nperiod, while a crowd of\\nsome 300 persons congregated\\nin front of the State House\\nand around the area direct\\nly in front of its entrance,\\nknown as the ‘Horseshoe.’\\nwhich was used for vehicular\\nas well, as pedestrian ingress\\nand egress. During this time\\nthere were no efforts made\\nby the city officials to hinder\\nthe petitioners in their\\nrights of free speech and\\nassembly; rather, the po\\nlice directed their efforts\\nto the traffic problems\\nresulting from petitioners’\\nactivities. It was only after\\nthe large crowd had gathered,\\namong which the city man\\nager and chief of police re\\ncognized potential trouble\\nmakers. and which together\\nwith the students had be\\ncome massed on and around\\nwas one of the beakiest of\\nthe hawks during the week\\nlong deliberation which pre\\nceded the Cuba quarantine\\nlast October. Mr. McCone\\napparently has been intimat\\ning that he felt as early as\\nAugust and September that\\nthe Russians were putting\\noffensive missiles into Cuba.\\nAnother of the principal\\nadministration witnesses has\\nbeen Defense Secretary Mc-\\nNamara. He has beery at\\ngreat pains to show that the\\nfirst indisputable evidence of\\noffensive missile bases on\\nCuba came through the\\nphotos taken by the U-2\\noverflight of October 14. To\\ndrive home the point, he\\nshowed the last previous\\nphotos of the exact same\\narea photos which were\\ntaken on a flight of Septem\\nber 5, and which showed no\\noffensive missile sites. As a\\nresult there has grown up the\\ntheory of the \"photo gap\"\\nwhich supposedly existed be\\ntween September 5 and Octo\\nber 14. This theory lends\\nitself to a view dear to the\\ncritics of the administration,\\nand which seems to fit in\\nwith Mr. McCone’s testimony.\\nNamely, that the administra\\ntion failed to press home\\nphoto surveillance at the\\ncritical moment either be\\ncause of negligence, or be\\ncause of a jurisdictional bat\\ntle, or because it wanted to\\ndelay the crisis until the eve\\nof elections.\\nThe facta are very differ\\nent. Through most of 1961\\nand 1962 U-2 flights over\\nCuba were going on at the\\nrate of two a month. In Sep\\ntember, 1962, the rate was\\nincreased to four per month.\\nThe flight of September 5\\ncovered the western part of\\nthe island where offensive\\nShe next handed out re\\ntraining certificates to for\\nmer coal miners now em\\nployed as meta) workers by\\nthe FMC corporation.

She\\nhas the time to giy^ it as her\\nthe ‘Horseshoe’ so closely\\nthat vehicular and pedestrian\\ntraffic was materially im\\npeded, that any action\\nagainst the petitioners was\\ntaken.\\n“Then the city manager, in\\nwhat both the State Inter\\nmediate and (State) Supreme\\nCourt found to be the utmost\\ngood faith, decided that dan\\nger to peace and safety was\\nimminent. Even at this junc\\nture no orders were issued by\\nthe city manager for the\\npolice to break up the crowd,\\nnow about 500 persons, and\\nno arrests were rqade In\\nstead, he approached the re\\ncognized leader of the peti\\ntioners and requested him to\\ntell the various groups of\\npetitioners to disperse within\\n15 minutes, failing which\\nthey would be arrested.\\n“Even though the city man\\nager might have been honest\\nly mistaken as to the immi\\nnence of danger, this was\\ncertainly a reasonable request\\nby the city’s top executive\\nofficer in an effort to avoid\\na public brawl. But the re\\nsponse of petitioners and\\ntheir leader was defiance\\nrather than co-operation.”\\nJustice Clark noted that\\nfor the next 15 minutes the\\npetitioners “conducted what\\nthe South Carolina Supreme\\nCourt found to be \\'a noisy\\ndemonstration in defiance of\\n(the dispersal) orders’”\\nThe basic question is\\nwhether the local police have\\na right to prevent a riot or\\nwhether they must wait until\\ncasualties actually occur. The\\nAmerican people have always\\nfelt that local disturbances\\nare for the States and cities\\nto handle.\\nThe only available remedy\\nnow is the passage by Con\\ngress of a law taking away\\nfrom the Supreme Court of\\nthe United States any right\\nto consider cases involving a\\nbreach of the peace when a\\nState Supreme Court has al\\nready passed on the issues\\ninvolved. There is precedent\\nfor this type of legislation.\\nThe Constitution itself spe\\ncifically gives Congress the\\nright to pass a law limiting\\nor removing appellate juris\\ndiction from the Supreme\\nCourt of the United States\\nin such cases as the lawmak\\ners may deem desirable.\\n(Copyrltht. lass)\\nmissile launching sites were\\nnot yet under construction.\\nSubsequent flights on Sep\\ntember 17, 26 and 29. and on\\nOctober 5 and 7 turned up\\nnothing, either because the\\nsites were not yet in, or be\\ncause the wrong a<-eas were\\ncovered, or because of cloud\\ncover.\\nMany scheduled flights had\\nto be cancelled because of\\nbad weather. That is how it\\nhappened that the first In\\ndisputable evidence came on\\nOctober 14.\\nIt is true, as the White\\nHouse has announced, that\\non October 6, Air Force planes\\nwere substituted for CIA\\nplanes in the over-flight op\\neration. But that came about\\nnot, as has been alleged, be\\ncause of a jurisdictional fight\\nwhich delayed photo opera\\ntions. The fact is that the Air\\nForce planes were technical\\nly inferior. The change was\\nmade mainly because the Air\\nForce had more planes avail\\nable.\\nAs to Senator Keating, the\\nprevailing confusion has\\nmade it seem that the ad\\nministration was either wrong\\nor disingenuous while he was\\nright all along. But has It\\nbeen all along? And Mas he\\nbeen right? His first mention\\nof offensive missiles in Cuba\\nseems to have occurred, not\\nIn August and September as\\nso many suppose, but in a\\nSenate speech of October 10.\\nAt that time he referred to\\n“at least a half-dozen launch\\ning sites for Intermediate\\nRange Tactical Missiles.’’ In\\nfact, only three launching\\nsites were ever discovered. By\\nitself the disparity in num\\nbers may seem unimportant.\\nBut it suggests that the\\nsource of the Senator’s infor\\nmation was the under-cur\\nrent of refugee gossip which\\nlooks good in hindsight, but\\nupon which no responsible\\nGovernment can take action\\nwithout supporting evidence.\\nfamily —two girls are\\ngrown.\\nShe is helping to fill a\\nvacuum which has privately\\nworried Democrats of the\\nmore crusading types.\\nMrs. Johnson\\'s activities\\nshould be helpful to her hus\\nband in the area of his\\ngreatest weakness, which is\\nthe big Industrial States.

I intended certainly\\nto have made a clean thing\\nof that matter, as 1 did last\\nwinter, when 1 went into Mis\\nsouri and there took slaves\\nwithout the snapping of a gun\\non either side, moving them\\nthrough the country, and fi\\nnally leaving them in Cana\\nda.\\nI have another objection,\\nand that is that it is unjust\\nthat I should suffer such a\\npenalty. Had 1 interfered in\\nthe manner which I admit\\nand which 1 admit has been\\nfairly proved had 1 so in\\nterfered in behalf of any of\\nthe rich, the powerful, the\\nintelligent, the so-called great\\nor in behalf of any of their\\nJOHN BROWN\\nfriends, either father, moth\\ner, brother, sister, wife or\\nchildren, or any of that class,\\nand suffered and sacrificed\\nwhat I have in these interfer\\nences, it would have been all\\nright, and every man in this\\ncourt would have deemed it\\nan act worthy of reward ra\\nther than punishment.\\nINTERFERED IN\\nBEHALF OF POOR\\nThis court acknowledges\\ntoo, as I suppose, the validity\\nof the law of God. I see a\\nbook kissed which I suppose\\nto be the Bible, or at least\\nthe New Testament, which\\nteaches me that all things\\nwhatsoever I would that men\\nshould do to me, 1 should do\\neven so to them. It teaches\\nme further to remember them\\nthat are in bonds as bound by\\nthem.\\nI endeavored to act up to\\nthat instruction. 1 say 1 am\\nyet too young to understand\\nthat God is any respecter of\\npersons.\\nI believe that to have in\\nterfered as I have done, as 1\\nhave always freely admitted\\n1 have done, in behalf of His\\ndespised pooT, is no wrong\\nbut right.\\nNow, if it is deemed nec\\nessary that 1 would forfeit\\nmy life for the furtherance of\\nthe ends of justice, and min\\ngle my blood further with\\nthe blood of my children and\\nwith the blood of millions in\\nthis slave country whose\\nrights are disregarded by\\nwicked, cruel and unjust en\\nactments, 1 say let it be done.\\nSEN. PAT McNAMARA\\nMilitary\\nContractors\\nFeather Their\\nOwn Nests\\nNEW YORK.—A fine sum\\nmary of the methods used by\\nmilitary contractors to feather\\ntheir own nests at the expense\\nof the taxpayer is contained in\\nan aricle on “The Political\\nEconomy of Armaments” by\\nMichael A. Lebowitz in t h e\\nwinter issue of “Sanity,” a\\nstudent magazine devoted to\\npeace and disarmament, pub\\nlished at the University of Wis\\nconsin, (P.O. Box 2015, Madi\\nson, 5, Wisconsin.)\\nEconomist Lebowitz pulls\\ntogether the generally - un\\nheeded revelations and warn\\nings of congressional hearings,\\nSen. Douglas and others on the\\nprofiteering of the munitions\\nmerchants.\\nOne interesting point is the\\nway these companies are able\\nto make the public pay even\\nfor their advertising. For ex\\nample, all advertising in trade\\nand technical journals is allow\\ned as a cost of the military\\nmanufacturer.\\n“A general idea as to the\\nextent of advertising dollars\\nthis involves can be obtained\\nby looking at any single issue\\nof a trade or technical journal.\\nA spot check, for example, of\\nthe April 1961 issue of the Sci\\nentific American revealed the\\nequivalent of 30 ad\\nvertisements on defense and\\nspace items by major produc\\ners. Under their cost-plus for\\nmula, the companies not only\\nare fully compensated for\\ntheir advertisements of their\\nown products, but also receive\\na percentage profit on the cost\\nof the advertisements. Thus, a\\ncorporation working on a cost\\nplus 10% basis can place a se\\nries of ads for $lO,OOO, have\\nthis included in its costs, and\\nreceive $l,OOO additional on\\nits contract.”\\nAnd even the ads that ap\\npear in popular outlets, such\\nas Life or the Saturday Even\\ning Post, can be deducted as\\na general business .expense and\\nwill thus be subsidized 50%\\nby the U. S. taxpayers.\\nAfter reviewing in and e t a i 1\\nmany other ways whereby the\\narmament manufacturers pile\\nup profits out of the bottomless\\npit of militarism, he concludes\\nthat, “For those currently\\nreaping the profits of defense\\ncontracts, peace and disarma\\nment pose a genuine threat . . .\\nCan we expect these groups to\\nuse their power and influence\\nto work for a goverement po\\nsition which can lead to effec\\ntive disarmament?” The an\\nswer is fairly obvious at\\nleast to students who want to\\nsurvive in an age of insanity.\\nSenator McNamara\\nA New Bill (or a Permanent\\nU.

Fifty\\ntwo persons under sentence of\\ndeportation will reopen their\\ncases in the Ninth Circuit Court\\nof Appeals before April 26,\\n1962, as a result of the recent\\nly passed Amendment to the\\nWalter-McCarran Law.\\nThe new ruling curtails judi\\ncial review so that it is no\\nlonger possible for persons ap\\npealing a deportation order by\\nthe Immigration and Naturali\\nzation Service to go to the\\nDistrict Court.\\nThe Second provision of the\\nAmendment provides that cas\\nes may not be taken from the\\njurisdiction of the state in\\nwhich the order originated.\\nAccording to the third pro\\nvision of the Amendment, all\\npetitions for Judicial Review,\\nmust be made within six\\nmonths of the issuance of the\\nfinal order, or within six\\nmonths of the issuance of the\\nfirial order, or within s i x\\nmonths from the date of the\\nfinal enactment. It is on this\\nlatter provision that the fifty\\ntwo cases must all be appeal\\ned.\\n“We have spent $500,000\\nand twelve years fighting our\\ncases up to the Supreme Court,\\nand we will do it all over\\nagain if necessary,” declares\\nthe Rt. Rev. Walter Mitchell,\\nhonorary Chairman, “Life as\\na deportee is almost like being\\nin jail. They have never com\\nmitted any crime, but they\\nare sentenced to lifetime pa\\nrole, and have to report reg\\nularly to the Parole Officer, as\\nthough they were criminals.\\nNo matter what the outcome is,\\nwe are prepared to go to Court\\nto fight for their freedom\\nagain.\"\\nMost of the Deportees were\\nbrought to the United States\\nas young children, and were\\nwholly educated here. They\\nhave been arrested for depor\\ntation under the 1952 Walter-\\nMcCarran Act, because they\\nhad been active in Unions and\\nin the Unemployment Move\\nment of the thirties.

It was the first English edition which intro\\nduced the numbering of verses, and was first published\\nas a whole at Geneva in 1560.\\nIt was called the Breeches Bible because of the\\ntranslation of Genesis 3:7.\\n“they sewed fig leaves together\\nand made themselves aprons.’’\\nIn the Geneva Bible the word\\n“breeches” was used instead of\\n“aprons.”\\n•• • *\\nQuestion: “Will you please\\ntell me what I can find in the\\nBible concerning the unwed\\nmother or the illegitimate\\nchild?”\\n.

       "  'raw_text': 'Negro Union Members\\nHave Responsibility\\nAFL-CIO labor leaders have been quick to point\\nout in their controversy with the NAACP that the\\nNegro trade unionists also have a responsibility to\\nwork within the labor movement to end race dis\\ncrimination by trade unions.\\nIt is not enough for the Negro trade unionists\\nto point out the long fight which A. Phillip Randolph\\nand Milton Webster of the Pullman Porters Brother\\nhood have put up within the trade union movement,\\nand the many rebuffs they have received from the\\nleaders of organized labor like AFL-CIO President\\nGeorge Meany.\\nThe formation three years ago of the American\\nNegro Labor Committee was the direct result of the\\nfailure of the AFL-CIO to come to grips with the\\nrace discrimination situation with even \"the deliber\\nate speed” suggested by the U.S. Supreme Court in\\nthe school segregation cases.\\nDespite all of this, when the AFL-CIO leader\\nship suggests that Negro trade union members have\\nan individual responsibility to become active in their\\nunions, they are on sound ground. Dues paying mem\\nbers who never show up at a meeting except around\\nelection time and often not then, need not expect\\nby their mere presence on the membership books\\nof the union to exert influence against race discrim\\nination in their own union or other unions.\\nIn the Twin Cities the only predominantly Ne\\ngro labor union Local 516 does not hold membership\\nin the St. Paul Trades and Labor Assembly and\\nneither does the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Por\\nters.\\nWhatever the reason these unions are not affil\\niated with either of the Twin City labor bodies, it\\nwould seem at first glance with no knowledge of\\nthe reason at hand, that such affiliation certainly\\nshould be maintained in the Interest of the Negroes\\nwho are dues paying members of those unions and\\nothers.\\nUnions like other American organizations in\\nbusiness and industry are overly suspicious of \"out\\nsiders”. This places upon Negroes who carry union\\ncards a large responsibility for helping change those\\npolicies of which the organized labor movement is\\naccused—by doing their job within the labor union\\nThe Taconite Issue:\\nLet Minnesotans Decide\\nThere are two things wrong with the taconite\\ntax amendment which has been brought to life again\\nas a result of an agreement between the steel in\\ndustry and the United Steelworkers.\\nThe first is that the state constitution is not the\\nplace for legislation. The constitution should be a\\nbody of fundamental law. Ours already contains too\\nmuch legislation, which is one reason for the per\\nennial drive to amend it and “bring it to date”. The\\nprovisions in the constitution that tend to get out\\nof date are the legislative provisions, like the tac\\nonite amendment.\\nThe second is that the move for the taconite\\namendment has its origins and being in the Industry\\nthat expects to gain a great deal from it. Special\\ninterest legislation is not of course unheard-of. Nor\\nis it necessarily undesirable, though it surely should\\nbe scanned very carefully. In this instance, however,\\nthe steel industry is asking for a most remarkable\\nbit of special consideration and is offering absolute\\nly nothing in return, not even the promise of a tac\\nonite plant.\\nThe high pressure means by which a body of\\npublic opinion has been built up and certain groups\\ndragooned into line on this issue is a matter which\\nshould give every citizen cause for serious concern.\\nUp to now the basic decisions on this proposed\\namendment appear to have been made in Pittsburgh.\\nWhen Minnesota gets around to making its de\\ncisions, we trust that they will be quite different\\nWe don’t believe that the average Minnesotan wants\\nto let the big steel corporations amend our constitu\\ntion.\\nWCCO-TV Airs The\\nInoculated Milk Controversy\\nWCCO-TV performed a service recently, on its\\nlate news program, that is of much greater im\\nportance than may appear to most listeners.

Indeed,\\nall milk probably carries anti-bodies produced by the\\ncow as a natural process of combatting infection.\\nThese anti-bodies survive pasteurization, ordinary\\ncooking, butter-making, the cheese-making, and most\\nother manufacturing processes. And this may be\\none reason why families using dairy products ex\\ntensively in their diets are often so free of infec\\ntions.\\nWhat the University scientists did was to in\\nduce the cow to produce specific anti-bodies to com\\nbat specific ills, by injections in the cow\\'s udder.\\nThe result is that many sufferers from asthma and\\nhay fever are able to get relief during the season.\\nIndeed, the fame of Minnesota\\'s milk has spread far\\nand wide, despite the silence conspiracy; and hordes\\nof tourists come here every summer to enjoy its\\nbenefits. In addition, many a sufferer from arthritis\\nhas seen his affliction cured.\\nSome doctors, defying the dictum of the medical\\npowers that be, are now trying the inoculated milk\\nmethod on cancer and multiple sclerosis patients,\\namong others. They are cautious about making\\nclaims, but some of them do report that they are\\nencouraged by results in such cases.\\nTo the ordinary layman, it is puzzling why all\\nthe stops have not by this time been pulled for re\\nsearch in this area. Why has the University of Min\\nnesota in the biggest dairying state of the United\\nStates, dragged its feet in the investigation of the\\nmeaning and potential benefits of this unique quality\\nof milk? Why, indeed, have not the discoveries al\\nready made received the nation-wide attention that\\nthey deserve?\\nPerhaps a few boosts and nudges, such as the\\nWCCO-TV report will start to get the matter proper\\nattention.\\nPleading The Highway\\nDepartment Guilty\\nPartisans of Highway Commissioner Marshall\\nhave up to now successfully opposed Representative\\nFred Cina\\'s move for an investigation of charges\\nthat the State Highway Patrol enforces a quota\\nsystem upon the patrolmen in the Issuance of arrest\\ntickets. They might as well have pleaded guilty for\\nthe highway department If the department were in\\nnocent, its friends and apologists would have been\\neagerly demanding the opportunity to prove the\\ncharges groundless.\\nThe airing of the charges at this time gives\\nsubstance to a suspicion which many a motorist has\\nheld during most of the time that General Marshal]\\nhas been highway commissioner.\\nA traffic ticket, unless the motorist is willing to\\nspend the great amount of time and considerable\\namount of money necessary to fight it beyond the\\nlocal court, is a permanent black mark on the\\ndriver’s record. It places in jeopardy his very right\\nto drive. In many of our suburbs and sometimes\\neven in some of our larger cities, these tickets are\\nhanded out rather freely, even carelessly or irres\\nponsibly. Until recently, the state highway patrol\\nhas been considered above this sort of thing. But\\nthings appear to many drivers to have changed, and\\nnow we are given a possible reason why.\\nOne other curious thing about the Cina charges\\nis their implied reflection upon the local courts. A\\nquota system, a system of handing out a fixed min\\nimum of traffic violation charges, must rely heavily\\nupon judges who will back up the system. Otherwise,\\ntraffic courts would be clogged with the cases of\\nmotorists and there are a great many—who feel\\nthat they have been unjustly charged and want to\\ndefend themselves. One phenomenon noted on our\\nstate highways during the past year is line-ups of\\nfour to eight cars that have been halted by the pa\\ntrol for wholesale ticketing. The patrol must have a\\nlot of confidence that the judge who gets such cases\\nwill be in the “proper” frame of mind for judging\\nthem. If he is inclined to give weight to pleas of\\nInnocent, then such cases must go next time to\\nother judges with opposite inclinations, or the sys\\ntem breaks down.\\nWe hope that this whole matter gets a thor\\nough airing.\\nBaring The Fact\\nA survey by a University of Minnesota student\\nhas determined that 65 per cent of the male stu\\ndents don’t wear hats, while 35 per cent wear some\\nkind of covering against the cold.

This favor-|MMMMHBBBB\\nable reception isg\\na result of the®/\\niron-mining com-S><\\npanics\\' bid 1 n ■\\ntheir time until? J.-, JP\\nthe United\\nWorkers U n 1 o\\nwas forced to JD /\\ncept the ■\\'(\\'\\nals of the mining Everett Luotna\\ncompanies because of the desperate\\nunemployment conditions on the\\nRange.\\nThis action on the part of the\\nunion is a result of a refusal on\\nthe part of the union to recognize\\ntheir real problems. The mining\\ncompanies argue that cheap labor\\nin foreign countries, especially\\nVenezuela, places Minnesota in an\\nunfavorable competitive position.\\nWhat Minnesota must therefore do,\\naccording to the mining compan\\nies, is give tax concessions so that\\nthere would be greater incentive\\nfor the companies to mine Minne\\nsota.\\nThe United Steel Workers Union\\nshould have taken the following\\nfactors into consideration for a\\npossible key to a solution to their\\nproblem before the situation on the\\nRange became critical. Specific\\ndangers of the taconite amend\\nmend will be discussed in a later\\ncolumn.\\n(1) The present instability of\\nthe Venezuelan government. Be\\ncause of the extremely low stand\\nard of living of the peasantry in\\nVenezuela, Venezuela is in constant\\ndanger of revolution.\\nIf a revolution would occur,\\nAmerican mining companies would\\nlose this prime source of iron ore.\\nBecause of this unstable situation,\\nthey would attempt to take out of\\nVenezuela as much of the ore as\\npossible even though it were more\\nexpensive to mine than the ore of\\nNorthern Minnesota.\\nDuring this time, however, they\\nwould be expected to use this im\\nportation of ore as a weapon to\\nsecure themselves beneficial condi\\ntions on the Range. The taconite\\namendment attempts to guarantee\\nthat Minnesota will be benefitted\\nas little as possible from its own\\nnatural resources if at any time\\nrestrictions are placed on Venezue\\nlan ore.\\n(2) The relevance of the condi\\ntions of the working class of Vene\\nzuela to those of Minnesota. As\\nsuming that the sole reason for the\\nimports of ore from Venezuela is\\nbecause it is cheaper, why is it\\ncheaper ? One reason is because\\nthe miners in Venezuela are merely\\nbeing paid a pittance for their\\nlabours. The United Steel Workers\\nUnion should only support candi\\ndates for public office who are in\\nterested In raising the living con\\nditions of Venezuelan miners. Now\\nin effect what they do is support\\ncandidates who wish to maintain\\ncompetition by lowering the level\\nof American miners to that of the\\nVenezuelan miners.\\n(3) Lack of a steel Industry\\nwithin Venezuela. If the mining\\ncompanies would permit Venezuela\\nto have its own steel industry,\\nVenezuelan ore could be used with\\nin Venezuela and not shipped to\\nthe United States to compete with\\nthe ore from Minnesota.\\nThe reason for this lack of in\\ndustry is obvious. The low wages\\nwithin Venezuela create an un\\nstable situation which makes in\\nvestment of capital by the corp\\norate interests dangerous. The pa\\nradox is that these corporate in\\nterests are also the ones who pay\\nthe low wages that create the un\\nstable situation. Because of the\\nstable situation within the United\\nStates, the ore is shipped to the\\nUnited States. It certainly should\\nbe in the Interests of the United\\nSteel Workers Union to search for\\nsolutions to this paradox. As it is\\nnow, the union is merely an unwill\\ning tool of the mining companies\\nagainst the interests of the miners\\nand the state of Minnesota.\\n| Our Past This Week |\\nClip for Negro History Scrapbook\\nFeb. 1, 1810 Charles L.

Dues paying mem\\nbers who never show up at a meeting except around\\nelection time and often not then, need not expect\\nby their mere presence on the membership books\\nof the union to exert Influence against race discrim\\nination in their own union or other unions.\\nIn the Twin Cities the only predominantly Ne\\ngro labor union Local 516 does not hold membership\\nIn the St Paul Trades and Labor Assembly and\\nneither does the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Por\\nters.\\nWhatever the reason these unions are not affil\\niated with either of the Twin City labor bodies, It\\nwould seem at first glance with no knowledge of\\nthe reason at hand, that such affiliation certainly\\nshould be maintained in the Interest of the Negroes\\nwho are dues paying members of those unions and\\nothers.\\nUnions like other American organizations in\\nbusiness and Industry are overly suspicious of \"out\\nsiders\". This places upon Negroes who carry union\\ncards a large responsibility for helping change those\\npolicies of which the organized labor movement is\\naccused—by doing their Job within the labor union\\nThe Taconite Issue:\\nLet Minnesotans Decide\\nThere are two things wrong with the taconite\\ntax amendment which has been brought to life again\\nas a result of an agreement between the steel in\\ndustry and the United Steelworkers.\\nThe first is that the state constitution is not the\\nplace for legislation. The constitution should be a\\nbody of fundamental law. Ours already contains too\\nmuch legislation, which Is one reason for the per\\nennial drive to amend it and \"bring it to date\". The\\nprovisions in the constitution that tend to get out\\nof date are the legislative provisions, like the tac\\nonite amendment.\\nThe second is that the move for the taconite\\namendment has its origins and being In the Industry\\nthat expects to gain a great deal from It Special-\\nInterest legislation Is not of course unheard-of. Nor\\nla It necessarily undesirable, though it surely should\\nbe scanned very carefully. In this Instance, however,\\nthe steel Industry is asking for a most remarkable\\nbit of special consideration and Is offering absolute\\nly nothing In return, not even the promise of a tac\\nonite plant.\\nThe high pressure means by which a body of\\npublic opinion has been built up and certain groups\\ndragooned Into line on this issue is a matter which\\nshould give every citizen cause for serious concern.\\nUp to now the basic decisions on this proposed\\namendment appear to have been made in Pittsburgh.\\nWhen Minnesota gets around to making its de\\ncisions, we trust that they will be quite different\\nWe don\\'t believe that the average Minnesotan wants\\nto let the big steel corporations amend our constitu\\ntion.\\nWCCO-TV Airs The\\nInoculated Milk Controversy\\nWCCO-TV performed a service recently, on Its\\nlate news program, that is of much greater im\\nportance than may appear to moat listeners.

There are no side\\neffects, as with the so-called wonder drugs. Indeed,\\nall milk probably carries anti-bodies produced by the\\ncow as a natural process of combatting Infection.\\nThese anti-bodies survive pasteurization, ordinary\\ncooking, butter-making, the cheese-making, and most\\nother manufacturing processes. And this may be\\none reason why families using dairy products ex\\ntensively In their diets are often so free of infec\\ntions.\\nWhat the University scientists did was to In\\nduce the cow to produce specific anti-bodies to com\\nbat specific ills, by injections In the cow\\'s udder.\\nThe result is that many sufferers from asthma and\\nhay fever are able to get relief during the season.\\nIndeed, the fame of Minnesota’s milk has spread far\\nand wide, despite the silence conspiracy; and hordes\\nof tourists come here every summer to enjoy its\\nbenefits. In addition, many a sufferer from arthritis\\nhas seen his affliction cured.\\nSome doctors, defying the dictum of the medical\\npowers that be, are now trying the Inoculated milk\\nmethod on cancer and multiple sclerosis patients,\\namong others. They are cautious about making\\nclaims, but some of them do report that they are\\nencouraged by results In such cases.\\nTo the ordinary layman, It is puzzling why all\\nthe stops have not by this time been pulled for re\\nsearch In this area. Why has the University of Min\\nnesota in the biggest dairying state of the United\\nStates, dragged its feet in the investigation of the\\nmeaning and potential benefits of this unique quality\\nof milk? Why, indeed, have not the discoveries al\\nready made received the nation-wide attention that\\nthey deserve?\\nPerhaps a few boosts and nudges, such as the\\nWCCO-TV report will start to get the matter proper\\nattention.\\nPleading The Highway\\nDepartment Guilty\\nPartisans of Highway Commissioner Marshall\\nhave up to now successfully opposed Representative\\nFred Clna’s move for an Investigation of charges\\nthat the State Highway Patrol enforces a quota\\nsystem upon the patrolmen In the issuance of arrest\\ntickets. They might as well have pleaded guilty for\\nthe highway department If the department were in\\nnocent, its friends and apologists would have been\\neagerly demanding the opportunity to prove the\\ncharges groundless.\\nThe airing of the charges at this time gives\\nsubstance to a suspicion which many a motorist has\\nheld during most of the time that General Marshall\\nhas been highway commissioner.\\nA traffic ticket, unless the motorist is willing to\\nspend the great amount of time and considerable\\namount of money necessary to fight it beyond the\\nlocal court. Is a permanent black mark on the\\ndriver’s record. It places In Jeopardy his very right\\nto drive. In many of our suburbs and sometimes\\neven in some of our larger cities, these tickets are\\nhanded out rather freely, even carelessly or irres\\nponsibly. Until recently, the state highway patrol\\nhas been considered above this sort of thing. But\\nthings appear to many drivers to have changed, and\\nnow we are given a possible reason why.\\nOne other curious thing: about the Cina charges\\nis their implied reflection upon the local courts. A\\nquota system, a system of handing out a fixed min\\nimum of traffic violation charges, must rely heavily\\nupon judges who will back up the system. Otherwise,\\ntraffic courts would be clogged with the cases of\\nmotorists and there are a great many—who feel\\nthat they have been unjustly charged and want to\\ndefend themselves. One phenomenon noted on our\\nstate highways during the past year is Une-ups of\\nfour to eight cars that have been halted by the pa\\ntrol for wholesale ticketing. The patrol must have a\\nlot of confidence that the judge who gets such cases\\nwill be in the \"proper\" frame of mind for judging\\nthem. If he is inclined to give weight to pleas of\\ninnocent, then such cases must go next time to\\nother judges with opposite inclinations, or the sys\\ntem breaks down.\\nWe hope that this whole matter gets a thor\\nough airing.\\nBaring The Fact\\nA survey by a University of Minnesota student\\nhas determined that 68 per cent of the male stu\\ndents don’t wear hats, while 35 per cent wear some\\nkind of covering against the cold.

The mining\\ncompanies argue that cheap labor\\nIn foreign countries, especially\\nVenezuela, places Minnesota in an\\nunfavorable competitive position.\\nWhat Minnesota must therefore do,\\naccording to the mining compan\\nies, is give tax concessions so that\\nthere would be greater incentive\\nfor the companies to mine Minne\\nsota.\\nThe United Steel Workers Union\\nshould have taken the following\\nfactors into consideration for a\\npossible key to a solution to their\\nproblem before the situation on the\\nRange became critical. Specific\\ndangers of the taconite am end\\nmend will be discussed in a later\\ncolumn.\\n(1) The present Instability of\\nthe Venezuelan government. Be\\ncause of the extremely low stand\\nard of living of the peasantry In\\nVenezuela, Venezuela is In constant\\ndanger of revolution.\\nIf a revolution would occur,\\nAmerican mining companies would\\nlose this prime source of iron ore.\\nBecause of this unstable situation,\\nthey would attempt to take out of\\nVenezuela as much of the ore as\\npossible even though It were more\\nexpensive to mine than the ore of\\nNorthern Minnesota.\\nDuring this time, however, they\\nwould be expected to use this im\\nportation of ore as a weapon to\\nsecure themselves beneficial condi\\ntions on the Range. The taconite\\namendment attempts to guarantee\\nthat Minnesota will be benefitted\\nas little as possible from Its own\\nnatural resources If at any time\\nrestrictions are placed on Venezue\\nlan ore.\\n(2) The relevance of the condi\\ntions of the working class of Vene\\nzuela to those of Minnesota. As\\nsuming that the sole reason for the\\nImports of ore from Venezuela is\\nbecause It is cheaper, why is it\\ncheaper ? One reason is because\\nthe miners In Venezuela are merely\\nbeing paid a pittance for their\\nlabours. The United Steel Workers\\nUnion should only support candi\\ndates for public office who are in\\nterested in raising the living con\\nditions of Venezuelan miners. Now\\nin effect what they do la support\\ncandidates who wish to maintain\\ncompetition by lowering the level\\nof American miners to that of the\\nVenezuelan miners.\\n(8) Lack of a steel Industry\\nwithin Venezuela. If the mining\\ncompanies would permit Venezuela\\nto have Its own steel Industry,\\nVenezuelan ore could be used with\\nin Venezuela and not shipped to\\nthe United States to compete with\\nthe ore from Minnesota.\\nThe reason for this lack of In\\ndustry is obvious. The low wages\\nwithin Venezuela create an un\\nstable situation which makes in\\nvestment of capital by the corp\\norate Interests dangerous. The pa\\nradox Is that these corporate In\\nterests axe also the ones who pay\\nthe low wages that create the un\\nstable situation. Because of the\\nstable situation within the United\\nStates, the ore is shipped to the\\nUnited States. It certainly should\\nbe in the interests of the United\\nSteel Workers Union to search for\\nsolutions to this paradox. As It Is\\nnow, the union Is merely an unwill\\ning tool of the mining companies\\nagainst the Interests of the miners\\nand the state of Minnesota.\\n| Our Past This Week ]\\nClip for Negro History Scrapbook\\nFeb. 1, 1810 Charles L.

The written ruling,\\nwhich granted the defense re\\nquest, was issued today.\\nFirst, he said that \"judicial\\netiquette and canons of good\\ntaste” barred a judge from\\ndiscussing outside of proper\\njudicial channels statements\\nabout his actions.\\nThe judge said this was true\\n\"Irrespective of whether they\\nwere correct or incorrect,\\njustified or unjustified.” For\\nthis reason, he said, \"my Ups\\nhave been sealed.”\\nCites His Duty\\nBut, the judge said, the case\\nnow was before him as part of\\nhis judicial function. He said\\nhis duty now required him to\\n\"analyze” the appellate court’s\\nopinion.\\n\"Judge Danaher’s opinion,”\\nJudge Holtzoff said, “is exceed\\ningly prolix and constitutes a\\ndisorganized, desultory, dia\\ntribe.” He said the opinion dis\\ncussed a number of points, but\\ndecided only one.\\nJudge Holtzoff said the ap\\npellate court apparently only\\nruled that statements by Naples\\nduring a re-enactment of the\\ncrime should have been ex\\ncluded at the trial.\\n“Interspersed (in Judge\\nDanaher’s opinion) are a num\\nber of personal observations in\\na somewhat petulant tone,”\\nJudge Holtzoff said. He said\\nJudge Danaher seemed\\n“piqued” at one point.\\nJudge Holtzoff said Judge\\nDanaher apparently was piqued\\nby the fact that Judge Holtzoff\\nihad once written two articles\\npraising the English appellate\\ncourt.\\nCites “Misunderstanding”\\nJudge Holtzoff concluded\\nwith some general remarks\\nabout what he called “a grow\\ning misunderstanding as to the\\nrespective functions of trial\\nand appellate courts.”\\nThe judge said that interme\\ndiate appellate courts, which\\nhistorically came after trial\\ncourts had been established, are\\nsometimes said to exercise “su\\npervisory jurisdiction.”\\n“This is a picturesque and an\\napt figure of speech and, as\\nsuch it has its usefulness,” hq\\nsaid. “But like figures of\\nspeech generally, it must not\\nbe taken seriously.”\\n\"Strictly speaking, interme\\ndiate appellate courts have no\\nsupervisory jurisdiction,” Judge\\nHoltzoff said.
