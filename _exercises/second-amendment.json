The fishing\nboat sank. Two of its crewmen\nvanished into the churning sea.\nThe drama began when the\nfishing vessel Barbara Lee called\ntor help to get through huge\nswells at the narrow entrance to\nGrays Harbor. All day, winds up\nto 55 miles an hour had raked\nthe coast.\nThe Coast Guard sent the 52\nfoot patrol boat Invincible to\nguide the fishing boat across the\nbar. It was a familiar procedure,\nthe Grays Harbor bar is treach\nerous for small craft at all times.\nSuddenly a monstrous wave\nknocked the Invincible bottom\nside up. The boat slowly righted,\nbut its engines were dead. One\nof the four men aboard took a\nbad cut.\nThe 30-foot Barbara Lee stood\nby in the rain and wind. It threw\na line aboard the Invincible. The\nline broke. It tried to attach\nanother.\nThen a mountain of water en\ngulfed the Barbara Lee. First the\nfishing boat\u2019s smokestack and an\ntenna were swept away; then it\nsank. The Invincible got one fish\nerman, Harold Pernula of Cordo\nva, aboard. The others, skipper\nRobert Bolam, and crewman Ted\nSigardson, were nowhere to be\nseen.\nTwo other Coast Guard boats\nprowled the stormy waters in the\nhope that the men might be found\nbobbing about in life jackets. The\nCoast Guard sent an airplane, but\nfoul weather forced it back. The\nsheriff\u2019s office ordered the beach\npatrolled in case the men were\nwashed ashore.\nThe Coast Guard sent a larger\nI boat, the cutter McLane, to take\nI the Invincible in tow.\nGruenin\u00ab Reports \u2018Perfect\n; Zero\u2019 In Attempts to\nProcure Indiana Dunes\nWASHINGTON, UR \u2014 Efforts\nto get the Bethlehem Steel Co. to\ngive up some of its holdings on\nthe Indiana Dunes got nowhere\n| Wednesday.

But consider Canada with a $1 billion\nadverse trade balance.\nAlso, while we have $40 billion net in foreign\nassets abroad, Canada has a net external debt of\nabout $17 billion.\nTranslate both of these to our scale and it is as\nthough we had a $10 billion annual adverse trade\nbalance and $200 billion in external debt.\nBut because we are concerned over the drain on\nour gold and our adverse balance of payments, we are\ntaking measures which may worsen Canada\u2019s plight.\nThe \u201cBuy American\u201d directive, if rigidly en\nforced, could result in substantial dollar losses to\nCanada\u2014who, incidentally, buys 60 per cent of her\nimports from us. . . .\nThe consequence of this is that the new Canadian\nbudget revealed recently contains several proposals\ndesignated to make investment of American capital\nin Canada less attractive. . . .\nIn no sense is this \u201cretaliation\u201d on Canada\u2019s part.\nIt is simply that our two nations are in the same econ\nomic boat, when we start rocking same, Canada has\nto take offsetting action.\nThis is an important factor for the new Adminis\ntration to keep in mind when it tackles the problem\nof our balance of payments.

Until that is\ncompleted \u2014 by the end of this\nmonth \u2014 and turned over to the\nPresident and his budget makers,\nno firm estimate of the revised\nmilitary budget can be made.\nHowever, some preliminary\nmoves, made in response to Ken\nnedy\u2019s request for accelerated ac\ntion in defense programs, obvi\nously will cost more money which\npresumably would appear in the\nrevised fiscal 1962 bill.\nFirst of these items is addition\nof 55 jet and propjet transport\nplanes for troop and cargo air\nlift.\nResponding to the President\u2019s\nrequest, the Pentagon \u2014 like other\nfederal departments \u2014 is trying\nto eliminate spending for items or\norganizations that have become\nobsolete.\nBut the constantly mounting re\nquirements of defense virtually\nassure that an increase in military\nspending is in prospect.\nThese requirements arise out\nof the unrelenting arms race with\nthe Communist powers and swift\nstrides made in weapon technol\nogy. The demands have confront\ned both Democratic and Republi\ncan Administrations since World\nWar II.\nIn the nearly 16 years since that\nglobal conflict \u2014 including three\nyears of Korean War\u2014the United\nStates has spent more than half\na trillion dollars on defense.\nHow Much Docs\nYour Family Spend \u2014\nn 1 For What?\nNEW YORK \u2014 How much\n| docs your family spend \u2014 and\n1 for what?\nThe government wants to know.\nSo it\u2019s going to revise the\nmakeup of the cost of living in\ndex last updated in 1950.\nA lot of things \u2014 tranquilizers,\nj for instance \u2014 have become note\ni worthy items in the American\nI economy since then.\nAnd changing times have raised\nmany other questions, such as\nwhether the price of hamburger\nshould figure in the compilation.\nThe latest monthly index issued\nby the government was last De\ncember\u2019s 127.5 \u2014 meaning that\nprices of items listed were 27.5\nper cent over what they were in\nthe 1947-1949 period, which is\nthe 100 base.\nThe Labor Department plans a\ncomprehensive survey of con\nsumer spending habits because it\nbelieves the reporting value of\nsome of the hundreds of items that\nfigure in the index may be out\nmoded.\nThe survey will start in the\nNew York metropolitan area.\nThe plans were announced by\nEwan Clague, Commissioner of\n; Labor Statistics in the Depart\nment of Labor.

The dazzling white\ncapital. Algiers, is less than two\nhours by plane from the French\ncoast. The populous northern\ndivision elects deputies to the\nFrench National Assembly as\nthough it were a part of the\nmainland.\nFrench foods stock Algerian\ncases and shops Colons own\nmuch arable land They control\nthe wine production that makes\nup so heady a share of Algeria\u2019s\nexport trade.\nThough nine out of ten Al\ngerians are Arab or Berber,\ntheir country has a deeply\nrooted French culture. Once a\npart of anarchic Barbary. Al\ngeria was occupied by France in\n1830. given a name and a na\ntional entity.\nAlgeria is a vast country of\n862 781 square miles, relatively\nunderdeveloped but with po\ntential oil and mineral wealth.\nTime's attrition has turned\nmuch of it into a lifeless ocean\nof wind-carved sands and jagged\nmountains. As a whole the\ncountry is sparsely populated.\nMost of Algeria's 9.5 million\npeople live in the Tell. This fer\ntile strip of coastal hills and\nvalleys forms a green garden\nstretching some 600 miles be\ntween Morocco and Tunisia.\nCompressed into the Tell are\nAttorney General Rogers made a\nsurprise announcement.\nHe had a new approach to the\nsame problem, one which ho felt\nwould get around the constitu\ntionality issue. His plan would\ncharge Federal judges with the\nresponsibility of appointing \u201cref\nerees\u2019* to see to it that qualified\nvoters were actually permitted to\ncast their ballots in State as\nwell as in Federal elections. The\nreferees also would act to see\nthat registration of voters is con\nducted fairly.\nThe Rogers plan caused a bit\nof uncertainty among backers of\na strong civil rights measure.\nMany of them now were not sure\nwhich they like better\u2014the com\nmission's approach or the At\ntorney General\u2019s\nNorthern Democratic liberals\nwere particularly on the spot be\ncause in some ways the Rogers\nplan was stronger than the com\nmission's. To back the Attorney\nGeneral's proposal would mean\ngiving the Republicans credit for\nmeaningful civil rights action in\nthe presidential election year. And.\nas everyone knows, the all-but\ncertain Republican nominee, Vice\nPresident Nixon, is a close per\nsonal friend of Mr. Rogers. Mr.\nRogers let it be known that Mr.\nbate to eulogies of his four terms.\nRepublicans were concentrating\non party unity\u2014not one G. O. P.\nmember of the House or Senate\nvoted against the amendment.\nAs it originally passed the House\nthe resolution stated that anyone\nwho had \"served\" twice as Presi\ndent would be ineligible to an\nother term. The version sent to\nthe Senate floor by the Judiciary\nCommittee would have barred a\nthird term to anyone who had\n\u201cheld\u201d the office twice.\nWith this language there prob\nably would have been no confu\nsion. But there was much argu\nment in the Senate over the pro\nvision covering a Vice President\nwho served out part of a presi\ndential term. Senator Taft offered\nhis compromise with the key word\nchanged to \u201celected\u201d a few hours\nbefore the Anal vote.\nThe Senate Insisted dn the Taft\nlanguage and the House accepted\nthe altered form.\nThe Senate Subcommittee on\nConstitutional Amendment does\nnot regard the possibility of a\nPresident \u201csneaking\u201d back into\noffice for a third term as purely\nhypothetical. In a national crisis,\na staff member noted, there could\nbe heavy pressure for a President\nto stay on for a third term, as\nthere was with Roosevelt in 1940.\nHe might agree to run as Vice\nPresident with a \u201cstand-in\u201d who\nwould resign after the election.\nThird Term Pressure\nWhat would happen if a two\nterm President actually won nom\nination as Vice President?\nThurman Arnold, who has been\na judge on the United States Court\nof Appeals, an Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, a law professor\u2014and a\nstudent of Prof. Corwin\u2014says it\nwould probably work this way:\nNothing could be done legally to\nstop the candidate in advance of\nthe election. Congress, which tal\nlies the electoral vote, could keep\nhim from office by refusing to\nrecognize his votes as valid. But if\nhe were permitted to take office\nas Vice President there could be\nno effective court challenge un\nless he succeeded to the presi\ndency.\nWhen he began signing bills as\nPresident, a court case could be\nbrought on grounds that he was\nholding office unconstitutionally.\nBut Judge Arnold believes the case\nwould collapse and the United\nStates would have another third\nterm President.\n\u201cI'd give you about 25-to-l that\nthe Supreme Court would call it\na political question not within its\njurisdiction.\u201d he said. \u201cI think\nthey'd dodge that one like a hot\npotato.\"\nAlgeria's food basket and its\ncities.

S. Manufacturers\nBy SHIRLEY SCHF.IBLA\nContributing Writer\nThe Departments of State and\nAgriculture are weaving trouble\nfor the administration by exer\ncising two contrary policies on\ncotton.\nThe Agriculture Department\u2019s\naid to cotton growers keeps prices\nhigh. This brings about great out\nput, which results in turn in\ncotton surpluses. To keep the\nsurpluses from becoming unman\nageable, the Government has im\nport quotas to keep out \"cheap\u201d\nforeign cotton and export subsidies\nto get rid of surplus domestic\ncotton.\nThe state Department, on the\nother hand, wants to free world\ntrade channels bv making mutu\nally beneficial agreements with\nother countries to end all artificial\nrestrictions ion trade. It hopes\nto pursue this aim activelv when\nnegotiations open in September\nin Geneva with the member na\ntions of the Genera\u2019 Agreement\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT>.\nThis department believes that the\nUnited States has more to gain\nthan to lose because it is the\nvic'im of more restrictions than\nit carries out itself.\nThe trade philosophies of these\ndepartments have clashed on other\ncommodities as well, notably on\nwool. In addition, the United\nStates has a GATT waiver which\nenables it to restrict the quantities\nof imports of dairy products,\ngrains and Dutch cheese.\nManufacturers Alarmed\nThe cotton manufacturers in\nthis country contend that agree\nments such as the State Depart\nment wants would be disastrous\nfor them. They not only are\nworking hard to head off any such\ndevelopments, but are actively\nproposing further restrictions on\ncotton textile trade. They claim\nthey are at a disadvantage in\ninternational competition because\nthey are forced to buy high-priced\nAmerican cotton.\nForeign mills, on the other hand\nin addition to buying \"cheap\u201d\nforeign cotton, can buy American\ncotton at eight cents a pound\ncheaper than the price paid by\nTHE FOREIGN SCENE\nContinued From Page C-l\nsume the talks at any time \u2014if\nMoscow agreed to confine their\nscope to Lend-Lease.\nAtom Test Ban:\nNo 'Partials'\nLast week the American dele\ngation at the Geneva conference\non ways and means of ending\nnuclear weapons tests prepared\nto offer a compromise. In effect,\na partial ban would be agreed\nupon, with large underground\ntests barred but small tests un\nchecked. On Wednesday, before\nthe proposal had been presented\nformally to the conference, the\nSoviet delegation rejected it.\nFor almost 16 months repre\nsentatives of the Soviet Union, the\nUnited States and the United\nKingdom have been talking at\nGeneva on a world-wide cessation\nof nuclear testing. Their progress\nhas been measured in inches; the\nchief result to date has been only\nthat no nation has resumed test\ning in the absence of an agreement.\nSome hurdles have been scaled\nsuccessfully. But the present dif\nficulty appears the toughest, of all\nto date: American and British\ncontentions that nuclear tests can\nbe conducted underground with\nlittle risk of detection are chal\nlenged by the Russians, who Insist\nthat the issue was raised merely\nas a device to head off a work\nable test ban.\nIn a new effort to break the\nlog jam, the United States chief\ndelegate, James J. Wadsworth, was\nready last week to propose that\nlarge underground tests be banned\nbut that small ones be permitted\nuntil there was reasonable assur\nance that detection methods were\nadequate to check them.\n\u201cErsatz,\" said the Soviet chief\ndelegate, Semyon K. Tsarapkin,\nwhen told of the compromise pro\nposal by reporters. \u201cNonsense and\ntotally unacceptable.\u201d he added\nlater after talking with Mr. Wads\nworth. Only a complete and all\ninclusive ban would be acceptable\nto Moscow, he said, reminding the\nreporters that the United States\nUnited States manufacturers,\nthanks to an Agriculture Depart\nment export subsidy of that\namount.\nDomestic manufacturers don't\nwant to see this American cotton\ncome back here to give them com\npetition in the form of finished\ncotton. Actually, however, they do\nnot appear to be suffering any\nsubstantial damage at the moment.\nDespite recent increases, im\nports of cotton goods are running\nat a rate equal to only about\nthree per cent of American pro\nduction. Mill profits are high.\nConfronted with these facts, the\nmanufacturers say they want Gov\nernment protection against future\ntrouble. They say they are alarmed\nover the upward trend in imports\nof cottons. The industry here is\nnoted for its cyclical ups and\ndowns. Its representatives claim\nan increase in imports during a\n\u201cdown period\u201d could spell real\ntrouble.\nThrough the Commerce De\npartment they already have suc\nceeded in persuading Japan to\nlimit voluntarily its exports of\ncotton goods to the United States\nunder a highly complex formula\nJapan knew it faced the prospect\nof mandatory controls if it didn\u2019t\ninstitute voluntary ones.\nHong Kong Efforts\nNow the Commerce Department\nis trying to do the same thing\nwith Hong Kong but without the\nsame success. Henry Kearns. As\nsistant Secretary of Commerce for\nInternational Affairs, has traveled\ntwice to Hong Kong recently to\ndiscuss voluntary export quotas.\nHong Kong has proposed volun\ntary quotas on garments only,\nnot textiles, and it has said it\nwould only limit 1960 garment\nexports to a 15 per cent increase\nover 1959.\nNeither Mr. Kearns nor the\nAmerican mill owners are pleased\nwith this suggestion. Perhaps the\nmost disconcerted party, however,\nis Japan. The Japanese have in\nformed the United States Govern\nment that they are unhappy over\nthe Hong Kong situation and do\nnot intend to continue their\nhad voted in the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly for a complete\nban.\nCurious Cuba:\nResoite for U. S.\nOn Tuesday President Eisen\nhower reaffirmed his policy of\n\"no reprisals\u201d against Cuba for\nCastro attacks and expropria\ntions. Whether in response or\nnot, Cuban speakers and news\npapers suddenly eeased their\ndaily blasts at I\u2019ncle Sam.\nIt was possible in Havana, for\nthe first time since January of\n1958. to read a newspaper or lis\nten to a radio speech by a Castro\nofficial without encountering a\nsavage blistering of Yankee im\nperialism. The guns were silent.\nThere was no way of knowing\nwhether the silence was perma\nnent or even deliberate. But it\nwas real.\nAt his news conference on Tues\nday, President Eisenhower was\nasked about his intentions toward\nthe Castro regime. The emotional\nCuban revolutionary's speeches\nhad been growing ever more viru\nlent, and he was being echoed by\nhis Minister of Justice and othei\nhigh officials.\nWould the tlnited States slash\nthe Cuban sugar quota in retalia\ntion for Cuban attacks on the\nUnited States and for expropria\ntion of American holdings? No,\nsaid Mr. Eisenhower.\nReady for the question, the\nPresident read to the reporters a\nformal statement that was ob\nviously designed (1) to reassure\nthe people of Cuba on American\ngood intentions, and <2> to place\nthe thorny Cuban issue in the\nopen, especailly for the edifica\ntion of other Latin American\nnations. In it he warned Cuba,\nand indirectly other nations of\nthe Western Hemisphere, that it\nwas necessary \u201cto recognize and\ndefeat the intrigues of interna\ntional communism which are\naimed at destroying democratic\ninstitutions in Cuba and the tra\nditional and mutually beneficial\nfriendship between the Cuban and\nAmerican peoples.\u201d\nvoluntary quotas unless Hong\nKong institutes similar ones.\nHong Kong has performed the\nincredible feat of increasing cot\nton textile exports from 2.347,000\nsquare yards in 1958 to 27,884,000\nsquare yards in 1959.\nCotton textile makers here also\nare concerned about the trend\nin other Asian exports, India's\nexports have gone from 1,274,000\nsquare yards in 1958 to 14,335,000\nin 1959. Formosa\u2019s have gone from\n167,000 in 1958 to 6,509,000 in 1959,\nFor Pakistan the export jump is\nfrom 28.000 in 1958 to 5.782,000\nin 1959, and for Korea it is from\n4,793.000 in 1958 to 5.751,000 in\n1959.\nThe ultimate aim of the cotton\ncloth makers is to obtain manda\ntory quotes limiting the quantity\nof imports by categories of goods,\nmaking quotas most restrictive for\nlines most directly competitive\nwith American cottons.\nQuotes Are Asked\nEarly this month the Commerce\nDepartment\u2019s Textile Advisory\nCommittee called for such quotas.\nThe only public representative on\nthe committee abstained from the\nrecommendation. He is Martin\nGainsbrueh of the National In\ndustrial Conference Board.\nWhile it appears that' the in\ndistry won't get such quotas in\nthe near future, its representatives\nfeel they are making progress in\nthe direction of protectionism.\nTheir greatest coup has been their\nsuccess in persuading the White\nHouse to investigate the advisa\nbility of increasing present tariffs.\nPresident Eisenhower has di\nrected the Tariff Commission to\nmake an investigation to deter\nmine whether this is so. In his\ncommunication to the commission,\nthe President said he had been\nadvised by the Secretary of Ag\nriculture that export subsidies are\na loss to the extent of imports to\nthe United States.\nThe cost of the cotton export\nsubsidy program from its inception\nin 1956 through the current mar\nketing year is estimated at $7OO\nmillion. The amount of the subsidy\nvaries each year.\nFor the 1956-7 marketing year\nthe Agriculture Department's\nCommodity Credit Corporation\npaid a subsidy of 6'2 cents a\npound on 7.6 million bales of cot\nton for a total cost of $241 million.\nThe following year the subsidy was\nreduced to 5 cents a pound, and\nexports under it dropped to 5.7\nmillion bales. The export drop re\nsulted in the subsidy being re\nstored to 6\u2019-2 cents for the fol\nlowing year, when it failed to boost\nexports. Instead they dropped to\n2.8 million bales, and subsidy pay\nments, though at the original rate,\ntotaled only $9l million.\nFor the 1959-60 marketing year\nthe rate has been boosted to a\nrecord 8 cents a pound. Agricul\nture Department officials expect\nexports to total 5.5 million bales\nfor a subsidy cost of $220 million.\nFinancing Subsidy Plan\nObviously the Agriculture De\npartment is interested in cotton\ntextile tariffs as a means of fi\nnancing its multi - million - dollar\nexport subsidy program. The cot\nton manufacturers, however, look\nupon a tariff as a step along the\nroad of protectionism which they\nhope will lead to quotas limiting\nquanities of imports.\nThey reason that levying of new\ncotton textile duties would be at\nleast a tacit acknowledgment of\na need for curtailment of imports.\nThey then explain that when it\nbecomes obvious that tariffs will\nnot do this, then a further step\nmav be taken.\nThe mill representatives think\nit is a hopeful sign that they have\nbeen able to get .their product di\nrectly associated with the agri\ncultural program. Because farm\nblocs are powerful the world over,\nthe move tq free restrictions on\ntrade is expected to exempt agri\ncultural products.\nNEARBY VOTES\nFollowing are the votes of\nMaryland, Virginia and West Vir\nginia members of Congress on\nmajor roll calls last week:\nSENATE\nS. 2436.

William M. Colmer, D\nMiss., that would repeal the\n6% differential.\nColmar's bill has been\ncleared by the rules com\nmittee and is to come up foe\nHouse debate Thursday.\nIn a related move, Rep.\nThomas M. Pelly, R-Wash., in\ntroduced a bill Tuesday that\nwould substitute a regional\nallocation system for the dif\nferential setup.\nTollefson said the compro\nmise proposal would be offer\ned in the form of two amend\nments to the 1936 law that\nprovides for the differential.\nOne amendment would sub\nstitute a 4% differential for\nthe present 6%. This, he said,\nis based on a recent report by\nthe maritime administration\nwhich concluded that a 4.2%\ncost differential exists on the\nWest Coast in comparison\nwith ship construction on the\nEast. Gulf, and Great Lakes\ncoasts.\nThe second amendment\nwould establish a regional\ncontract allocation system\nunder which the secretary of\ncommerce could ask for bids\non ship construction in a\nspecific area if ha found the\nwork was needed there be\ncause of a depressed con\ndition in the industry.\nPelly\u2019s bill would have a\nsimilar arrangement. His\namendment would provide for\nthe number of ships involving\nconstruction subsidies to be\ndivided into four groups at the\nbeginning of each fiscal year.\nOne group would be designat\ned for each of the coasts.\nThe groups would be figur\ned on the basis of the over-all\nnumber of subsidy contracts\navailable in relation to the\nfacilities in privately owned\nshipyards in each region that\nare equipped to build the\nships.\nPally axplainad that if iha\nsecretary of commerce de\ntermined the lowest bid re\nceived under such an ar\nrangement. he would reject\nall bids from that region\nand invite bids on a nation\nwide basis.\nThe differential was origin\nally set up on the ground that\nship construction costs are\ngreater on the West Coast\nthan on the East Colmer and\nother opponents of the differ\nential contend it is no longer\nneeded.\nAmong all the flags of the\nUnited Nations, only that of\nCyprus bears a map of the\ncountry.\n.....\nMR.

In this case\nand in others we have the spectacle of State Department or other\nappointees deciding that American tax money will be used out\nside our borders for purposes which are specifically barred by the\nConstitution, inside our borders.\nBy now the foreign aid system has gained solid entrench\nment in the way of employes, a bureaucratic organization fighting\nfor its life and for retention of jobs, and backers who have profited\nfrom these yearly expenditures and who will continue to profit\nfrom them.\nOur Peace Corps has worked well. This is aid to nations by\nhuman beings working on very low salaries. This is the best form\nof aid; it is understood; it is aid from the heart and in leadership\nand technical ways that can improve a nation\u2019s people and their\nmaking of a living. This is the kind of aid we can expand. The\nold money give-away should be terminated as quickly as possible.\nPassman, no doubt reflects the will of the majority of the American\npeople.\nIt Can\u2019t Happen Again\nTHE YEARS HAVE BEEN so crowded with events that it is\nhard to realize that thirty have passed since the bank holiday,\n\"the day the money stopped\u201d by decrees from Washington, But\nthey have and Caroline Bird recalls in Look the courage, tragedy\nand humor of March 6, 1933.\nYes, there was a bit of humor. For one thing the late John\nD. Rockefeller, Sr., ran out of dimes and had to give his golf\ncaddy a dollar. There were novel ways of continuing business.\nIn Atlanta, a taxi driver accepted postage stamps. In Buffalo,\na winning prize fighter received his purse in potatoes and toma\ntoes. All of us who were alive then have stories of our own.\nAccording to the article, this cannot happen again. Federal\nDeposit Insurance, paid for by banks themselves, now guarantees\nbank accounts up to $10,000. More important, there are fewer\nbanks, and they are stronger. Economic indicators exist to forecast\ntrouble.\n\"Almost everybody,\u201d says Miss Bird, \"now distinguishes be\ntween real wealth and the yellow stuff.\u201d\nConsidering that the United States now owes more gold than\nit owns, this is important\u2014if true!\nHouse Turns\nDown w4Liberty\u201d\nAmendment to\nU.S. Constitution\nJUNEAU OF) \u2014 The House Tues\nday turned down a resolution pro\nposing a so-called \u201cliberty\u201d amend\nment to the U.S. Constitution by\na vote of 10-27.\nThe proposed amendment would\nprohibit the federal government\nfrom engaging in any kind of\nbusiness except as specified in the\nConstitution, and ultimately would\nprohibit it from collecting personal\nincome taxes.\nThe vote came after more than\nan hour\u2019s debate which ran past\nthe noon hour.\nBefore the final tally, the House\nturned down two attempts to\namend the measure.\nThe first, sponsored by Rep.\nMike Gravel, would have exempt\ned a long list of federal activities\nin Alaska, such as the Bureau of\nIndian Affairs, public housing,\naid to education, the Army Corps\nof Engineers, the Alaska Railroad,\npublic airports, and the like. That\none went down on a 15-17 roll\ncall count.\nThe second amendment, offered\nby Rep. John Rader, would have\nspecifically exempted such power\nprojects as the proposed Rampart\nDam, and the Bradley Lake and\nSnettisham hydroelectric projects.\nThat one failed by a vote of 13-19.\nIn both cases, the authors of the\namendments argued that those\nwho wanted to go along with the\nproposed constitutional amend\nment \u201cshould realize that they\u2019d\nhave to live with it at home.\u201d\nRep. Wm. Boardman said that\nwhile many of the lawmakers\nmight sympathize with the amend\nments, the measure should be kept\nuniform since it also was being\nconsidered by other states.\nSpeaking for the resolution, Rep.\nEarl Hillstrand, said that he was\none of the sponsors of the meas\nure \u201cnot entirely because of its\ncontents, but because it is a blow\nagainst something of which I do\nnot approve\u2014bigger and bigger\ngovernment.\u201d\n\u201cI fail to grasp the practical ap\nplication of this measure in this\nday and age,\u201d said Rep. John Holm.\n\u201cPerhaps we should have passed\nit 50 or 150 years ago. But right\nnow it has little other than pro\ntest value.\u201d\nIn the final vote, those in favor\nof the measure were: Reps. Baker,\nBoardman, Cole, Hillstrand, Leon\nard, Miller, Parsons, Tillion and\nWhite.\nMarie Drake, Author of\nAlaska Flag Song, Passes\nJUNEAU WP>. \u2014 Mrs. Marie\nDrake, the author of the words to\nAlaska\u2019s Flag Song, died here yes\nterday after a long illness.\nMrs. Drake came to Alaska after\nthe end of World War I and took\nemployment with the Territorial\nDepartment of Education, rising\nto the post of Assistant Commis\nsioner in 1934.\nShe held the post until 1945.\nThere are no known survivors.\n\"DO IT ALL\nWITH ONE CALL\"\n\u2606\nModern Laundry\nAND\nDry Cleaners\n*\nComplete Dry Cleaning\nand\nLaundry Service\n\u2606\nFOR PICK - UP\nDial 2491\n\u2606\nJim and Ruth McLean\nProprietors\nJudge Hubert Gilbert\nGives Resume of\nComing Court Activities\nJudge Hubert Gilbert gave a\nresume of coming court activities\nat the Chamber of Commerce\nluncheon which get underway\nMarch 12 here at Superior Court,\nwith the grand jury which is fol\nlowed by trials.\nJudge Gilbert stated that the\nlocal court should be active\nthrough March and April with the\namount of work to be done.

He described the\nnew courtroom of the Anchorage\nbuilding as being very unusual\nand compact and in a circular\nshape.

S. Babaev, a Rus\nsian delegate to the recent North\nPacific Fur Seal Conference in\nTokyo.\nWade attended the meeting as\na representative of the State of\nAlaska.\nBabaev, Wade said, denied,\n\u201cwith great feeling, that any fish\ning Vessel captained by a Russian\nsea captain and manned by a Rus\nsian fishing crew would deliberate\nly destroy or damage fishing gear\nof another fisherman, particularly\nan Alaskan fisherman after the\ncooperation that has existed be\ntween the two fishing fleets over\nthe years.\u201d\nWade said Babaev told the U.S.\ndelegates that any incident that\nwas brought to their attention\nwould result in complete investi\ngation and punishment, if facts\nwarranted it.\nBabaev suggested that the Rus\nsians be advised of the type and\nkinds of markers used by Alaska\nking crab fishermen, the general\narea where they are located and\nthe density of the pots.\nHe said Russians would then\nexercise \u201cgreat and unusual care\u201d\nin these areas. Babaev suggested\nthat a radio beacon of some kind\ntuned to the radio frequency used\nby Russian ships be set up to\nmark the general area where\nAmerican pots are located.\nWade said the U.S. Fish and\nWildlife Service, the U.S. State\nDepartment and the Alaska State\nDepartment of Fish and Game, as\nwell as the American king crab\nindustry itself, had agreed to fur\nnish information to the Russians\nBabaev told Wade he planned to\nstop in Vladivostok and notify the\nRussian fishing fleet there of his\nconcern regarding the problem.\nAmerican fishermen complained\nlast year of a heavy loss of king\ncrab gear caused by the activities\nof Russian trawlers which were\noperating in the same general\narea, off the southern tip of Ko\ndiak Island.\nPROPOSE TRANSFERS\nJUNEAU Oft\u2014Two pieces of leg\nislation were introduced in the\nSenate Tuesday by Nome Demo\ncrats Lester Bronson and Pearse\nWalsh.\nThe first, SB 130, calls for the\ntransfer of the Forestry, Parks and\nRecreation branch of the Division\nof Lands from the Anchorage area\nto Juneau.\nThe other, SB131, would trans\nfer the Division of Aviation from\nthe Anchorage area to the Fair\nbanks area.\n' Miners & Merchants Bank of Alaska\n\"The Friendly Bank\"\nFULL BANKING SERVICES\nTo Northwestern Alaska Since 1904\n\u2014 BRANCHES IN KOTZEBUE and BARROW \u2014\nGuaranteed\nDependable\nFuel Service\nLP Gas\nand Appliances\nOffice: Dial 2561 Res: Dial 2417\nDEAL WITH CONFIDENCE AT\nGreen\u2019s City Fuel and Transfer\nZIEGLER\nand\nQUAKER\nSTOVE PARTS\nAND REPAIRS\nOIL HEATERS", "batch": "ak_jaeger_ver01", "title_normal": "nome nugget.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84020662/1963-03-06/ed-1/seq-2.json", "place": ["Alaska--Nome--Nome"], "page": "2"}, {"sequence": 11, "county": ["Orange"], "edition": null, "frequency": "Semiweekly", "id": "/lccn/sn92073229/1961-07-06/ed-1/seq-11/", "subject": ["Chapel Hill (N.C.)--Newspapers.", "North Carolina--Chapel Hill.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01206600", "North Carolina--Orange County.--fast--(OCoLC)fst01220945", "Orange County (N.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Chapel Hill"], "date": "19610706", "title": "The Chapel Hill weekly.

Examines\nSecond Amendment\nBy GEORGE KENNEDY\nThe second article of the\n10 original amendments, the\nBill of Rights of the Con\nstitution of the United\nStates, reads:\n\"A well regulated militia\nbeing necessary to the se\ncurity of of a free State, the\nright of the people to keep\nand bear arms shall not be\ninfringed.\nThe term \"Bill of Rights\u201d\nand the provisions for the\nright to bear arms come\nfrom the English Bill of\nRights passed by Parlia\nment after the bloodless\nrevolution of 1688 which\nplaced William, the Duke of\nOrange and his wife, Mary,\ndaughter of the deposed\nJames 11, on the throne.\nThe English bill of rights\nwas a limitation imposed by\nParliament over the power\nof the monarchy.\nIn his final futile efforts\nto preserve his authority,\nJames had asembled a force\nof 20,000 men at Hounslow\nHeath.\nThe maintenance of a\nstanding army In peacetime\nbecame regarded as an in\nstrument of regal tyranny.\nAlong with trial by Jury\nand indictment by grand\njuries, the right to bear arms\nwas written into the revolu\ntionary document.\nThis provision, a century\n\u25a1lder than our constitu\ntional amendment, did not\nprevent Britain from be\ncoming an unarmed com\nmunity.\nRecently a bank robber\nwas shot and killed by a\nbank guard In England.\nThis was generally consid\nered unfortunate and the\nGuardian asked why bank\nguards were allowed to\ncarry pistols when the po\nlice were not.\n_o\nMANY OF THE provisions\nof our Bill of Rights con\ncemipg freedom of religion,\nfreedom of speech and free\ndom of Che press were sug\ngested a^ l debated in the\noorlsotutlonal convention\nin Philadelphia in 1887.\nThey were rejected be\ncause. it was 1e44 that\ndenying certain powers\nto the Federal Government\nthey were creating would\nImply that otherwise it\nwould have such power. The\nFederal government was to\nhave no powers except those\nenumerated in the doument.\nWhen the Constitution\nwent to the States\u2014it was\nto go into effect when nine\nof the 13 had ratified It\u2014\nit was understood that sug\ngested amendments would\nbe considered by the Con\ngress it was creating.\nMore than 200 amend\nments were suggested by\nthe State conventions. Many\nsuggested the same thing in\ndifferent words. The pro\nvisions had to do with reli\ngion, right of petition, right\nof assembly, right to bail.\nThese amendments were\nall limitations on the power\nof the Federal government,\nnot on the States. The prob\nlem was not easy. Present\nday shibboleths such as\n\u201cfreedom of religion,\u201d and\n\u201cseparation of church and\nState\u201d would not get the\nfirst Congress over the\nthe passes of Jordan.\no\nTAKE THE WORDING of\nthe First Amendment:\n\u201cCongress shall make no\nlaw restricting an establish\nment of religion or pro\nhibiting the free exercise\nthereof.\u201d\nMassachusetts had an es\ntablished religion Con\ngregationalism, which con\ntinued until 1833. The Epis\ncopal Church in Maryland\nto this day, in establlshling\na new parish, requests an\nact of the legislature and\nthe legislature obliges.\nIt was James Madison,\n\u201cthe Father of the Consti\ntution,\u201d who undertook to\nplease the States by having\nCongress pass amendments.\nThis was in the first session\nof Congress in 1789 in New\nYork City Hall.\nAs in recent legislation,\nthe first Congress wrote the\nSecond Amendment in con\nference.\nThe House version had a\nprovision to exempt\nscientous objector from\nbearing arms. The Senate\nversion did not have it, and\nit was dropped by the con\nferees.\n\u201cMilitia\u201d at that time\nmeant that every able bodied\nman should respond, with\nfire arms, to the summons\nof the States.\nThat\u2019s how the Second\nAmendment got into the\nConstitution and there it is\ntoday.\nArmy Unit OKs\nHigh Dam Plan\nFor Seneca\n8 Projects Win\nApproval for\nPotomac Basin\nBy LEE FLOR\nStar Staff Writer\nA key Army Engineers\u2019 re\nview board has recommended\nconstruction of the controver\nsial high dam and reservoir at\nSeneca on the Potomac River.\nThe Seneca recommenda\ntions were part of a proposal\nfor eight major reservoirs, esti\nmated to cost 3242 million, on\nthe Potomac River and its tri\nbutaries.\nThe recommendations call\nfor complete Congressional au\nthorization for about half of a\nSSOO million, 18-reservoir Poto\nmac Basin plan recommended\nlast April, and ask for limited\ncongressional approval for\nmore study for the last half of\nthe basin plan.\nThe review board, the Board\nof Engineers for Rivers and\nHarbors of the Army Corps of\nEngineers, made its recommen\ndations yesterday to Lt. Gen.\nW. K. Wilson, chief of the\nCorps Engineers.\nTo Study Alternative\nThe Seneca recommenda\ntions call for careful study of\nan alternative for more elab\norate sewage treatment and\ndistillation of water, together\nwith possible use of water from\nthe Potomac estuary south of\nWashington.\nThe Seneca dam and reser\nvoir, estimated to cost sll7\nmillion, or over half the cost of\nthe \"bobtailed\u201d basin plan, is\nnot recommended for comple\ntion until 1977. However, ad\nvance acquisition of the site\nmay be authorized by Congress,\nand this may start within a\nfew years.\nThe next step in the ela\nborate process required for ap\nproval of the basin plan is for\nGen. Wilson and his staff to\ncomplete a preliminary report\nto Congress.\nThis may be completed with\nin three months The prelimi\nnary report automatically, un\nder Federal legislation, goes for\nreview to the District Commis\nsloners, the Governors of\nMaryland. Virginia, Pennsyl\nvania ond West Virginia, and\nto key Federal agencies.\n\u00a9\u2022er Dams in Plan\nThe other major reservoirs,\nestimated cost, and the pro\nposed completion date for con- :\nstruction, are as follows:\nRoyal Glen, W. Va., $32.3\nmillion. 1968; Chambersburg.\nPa., $134 million, 1969; Staun\nton. Va., S2O million. 1970; Six\nBridge. Md.. $15.5 million, ,\n1971; West Branch.

It has a tentative\ncompletion date of 1965.\nThe Seneca Dam has been\nheavily opposed in the Wash\nington area because it would\nneed about 44,000 acres of land\nin Maryland and Virginia.

F. new, dispatches.\nA-12\nTHURSDAY, JANUARY 19, 1961\nGracious Good-Bye\nPresident Eisenhower\u2019s final news\nconference was a pleasantly relaxed\naffair.\nAlthough the elght-year record of\nsuch meetings shows that Mr\u201e Eisen\nhower met the newsmen and women\nfewer times and more Irregularly than\ndid his immediate Democratic prede\ncessors, Franklin Roosevelt and Harry\nTruman, it likewise shows very few\noccasions of anything approaching un\npleasant or embarrassing exchanges.\nAnd if Mr. Eisenhower did not often\ndisplay as much relish for tilting with\nthe correspondents as his predecessors,\nit is worth noting that the conference\npractice itself was brought to a new\nhigh level of public usefulness. For the\nfirst time, for example, verbatim tran\nscripts were made available quickly\nafter the conferences, with the privilege\nof direct quotation.\nIt is a questionable innovation,\nIncidentally, which President-elect Ken\nnedy is proposing in the holding of \u201clive\u201d\nnews conferences before the television\ncameras. Undoubtedly there will be no\nlack of public interest in such meetings.\nBut we think there is serious doubt that\na Chief Executive in a spontaneous\nquestion-and-answer session can guard\nagainst an inadvertent word or gesture\nthat might be misinterpreted by the\nviewing audience with potentially harm\nful result. Even a \u201cno comment\u201d in some\ncircumstances can be translated into a\nvariety of meanings\u2014here and abroad.\nTo return to Mr. Eisenhower\u2019s fare\nwell, it was in keeping with his currently\nmellow mood on the eve of retirement.\nAgain, as he did on the previous evening,\nhe wished \u201cGodspeed\u201d to his successor\nand expressed, satisfaction at the\nsmoothness of the transition from one\nadministration to another. His concern\nthat this periodic transfer of power\nshould be accomplished efficiently and\nharmoniously was reflected in his\ninteresting proposal that it might be\nwise to advance election and inaugural\ndates, by constitutional amendment, to\ngive an incoming President more time\nto prepare plans and programs for a\nnew Congress. Os his personal plans,\nit was in keeping also with the record\nof his lifetime that he implied a willing\nness to serve Nation or party further if\nit seemed in the public Interest.\nFor their part, it was evident that\nthe near-record number of assembled\ncorrespondents were in a mood respon\nsive to the President's own. Figuratively,\nwe join them in their applause at this\nfinal \u201cThank you, Mr. President.\u201d\nNew Man at Justice\nAs most people expected, and as we\n\u2022think should have been the case, the\nnomination of Robert Kennedy as\nAttorney General sailed smoothly\nthrough the sometimes stormy waters\nof the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nExcept for a bit of Republican heckling,\nthe much-advertised \u201chearing\u201d on his\nnomination turned out to be pretty\nmuch of a love feast. The consensus\nwas, and, in fact, had to be that this\nyoung man\u2019s qualifications as the\nNation\u2019s chief legal officer would be\njudged, not on his record, which is\nnegligible, but on the basis of his per\nformance, which we hope will be of a\nhigh order.\nThis hope certainly finds support in\nthe experience of the outgoing Attorney\nGeneral, William Pierce Rogers. When\nBill Rogers came to the Justice Depart\nment as Deputy Attorney General in\n1953 he was older, but not much older,\nthan Bobby Kennedy is now. He had\nhad more experience in the practice\nof law, but one would hardly say that\nthe Rogers star had shone so brightly\nas to overwhelm and dim the light of\nhis contemporaries at the bar. Never\ntheless, as he prepares to step aside at\nthe still youthful age of 47, we have\nno doubt as to the nature of the\nInformed judgment respecting his\ncareer as Attorney General. It will be\nthat he has served with distinction.\nThe reason, or at least the primary\nreason, is that Attorney General Rogers\nhas devoted himself to serving and\nfurthering the cause of justice. It\nfollows necessarily that he has not used\nhis position to pay political debts or to\ninflict political punishments. Although\na close friend and warm supporter of\nRichard Nixon, he has not attempted\nto use his office to promote eithbr his\nfriend\u2019s or his own political fortunes.\nInstead, to repeat, he has devoted him\nself with notable efficiency to the job at\nhand\u2014the fair and vigorous adminis-\ntration of justice. If Bobby Kennedy\ndoes as well, those who have complained\nof his youth, his Inexperience, nepotism,\nor what have you, will find themselves\nwith a large self-serving of words to eat.\nMr. K. and Our Coil\nAlthough It must remain constantly\non guard against the ever-present threat\nof Communist subversion and aggres\nsion, the free world has reason to view\nwith great calm, if not contempt, Nikita\nKhrushchev\u2019s assertion that the day is\n\"not far off\u201d when Red totalitarianism\nwill conquer and rule the entire globe.\nAfter all, the ebullient Soviet\ndictator has long since demonstrated\nthat his crystal ball is more than a\nlittle bit clouded. At any rate, he has\nlooked at it in the past and seen things\nin it that were not really there. Thus,\nto cite but one example of his faulty\nclairvoyance, he has repeatedly pre\ndicted that agriculture in the USSR\nwould by this time be equalling or ex\nceeding our own country\u2019s tremendous\nfarm output. Actually, however, the\nRussian economy in that respect con\ntinues to lag far behind ours\u2014enough\nso to constitute a potential crisis in view\nof the fact that Russia\u2019s fast-multi\nplying population is sharply out of pace\nwith the food supply.\nBut this failure of his agricultural\nforecasts apparently has not discouraged\n,Mr. Khrushchev from predicting that\nthe whole earth\u2014including the United\nStates \u2014will soon be under the mastery\nof communism. This will be brought\nabout, he has suggested, not by all-out\nwar, but by a system of \"peaceful co\nexistence\u201d under which the Red total!-,\ntariani will win control of everything\neverywhere\u2014north, east, south and west\n\u2014throughout this mortal coil we call\nour world. Presumably, the sheer charm\n\u2022 of Soviet agents will speed up the con\nquest, but if that is not enough, then the\nmilitary power of the USSR\u2014as Mr. K.\nhas hinted, with the subtlety of a\nsledge-hammer\u2014will be used against\nany \u201ccapitalist\u201d power (meaning espe\ncially our own country) daring to resist\nthe forces of Communist \u201cliberation.\u201d\nIn setting forth this thesis in the\n20,000-word speech that has just been\npublished in Moscow, Mr. Khrushchev\n. has had some interesting things to say\nabout war. He does not like the idea of\na big nuclear conflict. He does not like\nit because he thinks it would be as bad\nfor the Soviet Union as for the United\nStates. Nor does he like \u201cbrush-fire\u201d\nfights that could lead to a major ex\nplosion. Indeed, as far as shooting is\nconcerned, the only thing he seems to\nfavor is the \u201cliberation\u201d struggle\u2014as in\nAlgeria and Cuba\u2014where the so-called\n\u201crevolutionary\u201d forces, if not actually\nin cahoots with the Kremlin, are strongly\ninclined to serve it.\nIn that sense, of course, the wars\nof \u201cliberation\u201d are limited strictly to\nthose who fight only for the USSR.\nCertainly, as mankind has seen, with a\nfeeling of shock and disgust, people in\ncountries like Hungary and Tibet\nstruggle for liberty only at the risk of\nbeing destroyed by the forces of Com\nmunism. Naturally enough, Mr. Khru\nshchev has said nothing about this and\nhis silence on it is supremely eloquent.\n9\nThe Cost of Fringes\nIt has become almost universal in\nlabor-management contract negotia\ntions that a package of so-called fringe\nbenefits figures importantly at the\nbargaining table. Although frequently\nstated in terms that make these seem\nrelatively insignificant, their cumula\ntive cost in dollars has become\nastonishingly heavy. Some, such as\nemployer payments to the social\nsecurity system, are Imposed by law\nand are not subject to negotiation.\nOthers are arrived at by direct bar\ngaining.\nThe National Industrial Conference\nBoard has drawn an interesting statis\ntical picture of how all these supple\nments to wages and salaries\u2014outlays\nby employers\u2014have mounted sharply\nduring the past quarter of a century\nto approximately $lB billion in 1960. At\nthis level, they represented 7.4 per cent\nof the $243 billion paid by Industry in\nwages, salaries and supplements. In\n1935, the total was about $5OO million\u2014\nor slightly more than 1 per cent of\ntotal outlays to personnel. And while\nemployer payments to social security\namounted to $5.2 billion last year, it is\nnotable that employer contributions to\nprivate pension and welfare funds\u2014\noften subject to negotiation\u2014totalled\n$8.5 billion.\nThis is a cost to industry that prob\nably will continue to rise and is in fact\naccepted with increased willingness by\nmanagement. Nevertheless, the paying\nof it constitutes a burden which all too\noften goes unappreciated.\n'To Your Health'\nNext to the weather, probably no\nsubject of conversation is more dear to\nthe American heart than health\u2014 one\u2019s\nown, that of others and more recently\nthat of whoever happens to be the Presi\ndent of the United States. Mr. Eisen\nhower\u2019s for example, has provided\nmaterial for interminable discussion\nand, it might be added incidentally,\nfor warm congratulations at this\nmoment.\nSo it is that the two young men,\nboth in their forties, who were com\npeting last fall for the prize of White\nHouse tenancy felt compelled to pro\nduce something in the nature of a*\ndoctor\u2019s certificate that they were sound\nof mind and body. It is, of course, a\ngood thing to be so, and now that John\nF. Kennedy of Massachusetts is about to\nlive in the \u201cgoldfish bowl\u201d at 1600 Penn\nsylvania avenue we are pleased and\nready to accept the verdict reported in\na publication of the American Medical\nAssociation that he is in \u201csuperb physi-\n\u2022 cal condition.\u201d He looks fit to us, and\nwe hope he stays that way.\nII FBWflRg\nt* ~T\n~ ,| _JD\nJ I ' \\ k\neS i / v\nKI I ; ? y\nJ 5 s Hl \\ J\nwk Wfe\nLETTERS TO THE STAR\nDealing With Russia\nThe theme of Bruce Cat\nton\u2019s articles on \u201cThe Need\nless War,\u201d if I read their in\ntent correctly, was that had\nthere been some kind of com\npromise prior to the Civil\nWar it might never have\nhappened.\nI hope I am again reading\nMr. Catton correctly when I\ngather that he is saying that\nin order to avoid a war that\nwill \u201cenvelope civilization In\nearthquake, wind and fire,\u201d\nwe should compromise with\nSoviet Russia and come to\nan agreement on doing\naway with all nuclear weap\nons.\nI do not agree with Mr.\nCatton that \u201ccompromise is\nwhat enables democracy to\nwork.\u201d A democracy cannot\nsurvive when it compromises\nwith truth, freedom, honor,\ncourage and loyalty. Com\npromise is only meant for\nuse In less important matters.\nThe United States rejected\nslavery and agreed whole\nheartedly with Lincoln that\na nation cannot live half\nfree and half-slave. But in\n1933 we abandoned that\nprinciple when wa recognized\nSoviet Russia, a nation ruled\nby masters over its slave\ncitizens.\nNo longer Is compromise\nspurned over slavery; we\nnow shut our eyes to the fact\nthat there can be no peace\nin a world half-free and\nhalf-alave. We have aban\ndoned the slaves behind the\nIron Curtain In preference\nto helping the \u201cbackward\npeoples\u201d of the world.\nCompromising with the\nGeorgia's Resistance to School Integration\nYour editorial \u201cShowdown\nin Georgia,\u201d points out that\nGov.

That Georgia\nfaced with a final court order\nhas one of two choices: Obey\nthe order or close Its public\nschools.\"\nBut the editorial over\nlooked a third choice which\nGeorgia has. namely, the\nlegislature can declare that\nwhat is purported to be a\nruling of the United States\nSupreme Court in Brown vs.\nBoard of Education et al, is\nnot a constitutionally au\nthorized ruling of the court,\nand hence Is unconstitu\ntional, invalid, and not law\nwithin the jurisdiction of the\nState. The ruling Is beyond\nthe authority granted, in\nthat the members of the\ncourt have attempted to ex\nceed their constitutional\npower which is limited under\nthe provisions of article 111\n.Jo \u201cjudicial power.\u201d\nGeorgia, one of the orginal\n13 Colonies, was a signatory\nto the Constitution of the\nUnited States. The power\nwhich the Supreme Court\nenjoys was conferred upon it\nby these 13 original States.\nTherefore, the Supreme\nCourt is a creature of the\nStates. No authority can be\nfound in the Constitution\nwhereby power was conferred\nupon the court in the mat\nters relating to public edu\ncation.\nThe public school systems\nin the States operate by vir\ntue of their respective con\nstitutions. It is entirely up to\na State whether it will or\nwill not provide a public\nschool system. All that a\nState has to do is to amend\nits constitution, and it would\nbe out of the public school\nbusiness. What then would\nbe the position of the court?\nWould it have the authority\nto compel a State to operate\na public school system? The\nanswer is that it has no such\npower. This places the court\nin a rather strange position.\nWhile having no original\njurisdiction over the estab\nlishment of schools in a\nState, yet it can step in and\ncontrol the schools once the\nState has made provision for\nthem.\nKitty L.

Eisen\nhower's future role in politics\nand in the councils of the Re\npublican Party remains to be\ndeveloped as he steps out\nof the White House. Very\ndefinitely, he leaves the presi\ndential office .still a great\nfigure in the minds of mil\nlions of his countrymen. In\nhis final press conference,\nMr. Eisenhower disclosed he\nfavors advancing the times\nof presidential elections and\npresidential inaugurations\nwhich he will discuss fully at\na later date. He has reached\nthe conclusion, too, that the\nTwenty-second amendment\nto the Constitution, limiting a\nPresident to two four-year\nterms is wise. Further, he\nstated that he will always be\navailable for consultation if\nthe leaders of the Republican\nParty wish to confer with\nhim.\nIt seems quite clear, how\never, that Mr. Eisenhower\u2014\nwho is probably to become\nGen. Eisenhower again, re\nverting to his old military\ntitle, won as commander-in\nchief of the Allied armies in\nthe Second World War\u2014will\nnot follow in the footsteps of\nhis immediate predecessor,\nformer President Harry S.\nTruman. Mr. Truman in 1956\nand 1960 supported candi\ndates of his own choice for his\nparty\u2019s presidential nomina\ntion, but without success.\nMr. Eisenhower gave his\nblessing to the candidacy of\nVice President Richard M.\nNixon for the Republican\npresidential nomination, but\nnot strongly until it was clear\nno other potential candidate\nwas left in the field. That is,\nuntil after Gov. Rockefeller\nof New York had withdrawn\nfrom the race. Even after the\nGovernor\u2019s announcement in\nDecember, 1959, that he would\nnot be a candidate, Mr. Ei\nsenhower continued to limit\nhis endorsement of Mr. Nixon\nto praise of his services in\nthe office of Vice President\nand his own personal faith\nin him.\nFavors Earlier Schedule\nA 8 a result of his experi\nences in the presidential of\nfice, Mr. Elsenhower is fa\nvoring the idea of earlier\npresidential elections and in\naugurations. If such a plan\nwere carried out, it would\nrequire a constitutional\namendment. He would not\ngo back to the old lame\nduck short sessions of Con\ngress, in vogue before the\nadoption of the Twentieth\namendment. But he would\ngive a new President at least\n80 days to adjust to his new\noffice, to draft his messages\non the state of the Union,\nhis budget message, and a\nlegislative program, before\nhe was forced to face the\nCongress. Mr. Eisenhower\u2019s\npoint obviously is that the\npresent system, under which\na retiring President who does\nnot leave office until 17 days\nafter the new Congress has\nassembled in Washington,\nmust submit his message on\nthe state of the Union and\na budget message during that\ninterval, knowing well that\nMass Transit Planning\nMany visitors to Washing\nton for the inauguration will\nbe appalled to find that\nWashington is not as clean,\nbeautiful, and dignified as it\nused to be. They will find\nthat Washington rapidly is\nbecoming another Los An\ngeles. We, too, have an air\npollution problem. We, too,\nare tearing down homes,\nschools, and commercial\nbuildings to make way for\nparking facilities, freeways,\nand bridge approaches for the\nexclusive use of pneumatic\ntired vehicles. Moreover, our\nprincipal mass transit system\nis deteriorating as bumpy\nsmoke-belching diesel buses\nreplace smooth, clean, com\nfortable streetcars.\nThe deterioration of the\nNation\u2019s Capital will proceed\nat an accelerating pace if\nCongress and the Executive\nBranch follow the advice of\nhighway and traffic engin\neers, whose mission seems to\nbe to perpetuate and increase\nthe jobs of such engineers;\nwho think in terms of motor\nvehicles instead of human\nbeings; and who promote an\nendless series of projects that,\ninstead of solving our trans\nportation problems, greatly\ncomplicate, delay, and in\ncrease the cost of electric\nrailway rapid transit con\nstruction and operation.\nIn Washington, as else\nwhere. highway and traffic\nplanners are dominating\ngeneral-purpose urban and\nregional planning, with the\nresult that mass transit, in\nstead of being used to help\nguide the directions of pop\nulation movement, patterns\nof growth, and the character\nof economic development, is\nexpected to serve merely as\nan overflow transportation\nfacility, with rapid transit to\nbe built only as a last resort.\nAs evidenced by a recent\ntalk by Washington\u2019s high\nway and traffic director be\nfore the Citizens\u2019 Advisory\nCouncil, many highway and\ntraffic engineers try to delay\nrapid transit construction\nand promote highway con\nstruction by conveniently\noverlooking the disadvanta\nges of concentration on high\nways, and overlooking the\nadvantages of railways. Ac\ntually, a good transit system\nin a large metropolitan area\nneeds both railway and high\nway transit vehicles. Those\nwho wish to delay rail rapid\ntransit construction like to\nuse New York City\u2019s recent\nhis successor will then be\ncalled upon to send his own\nrecommendations to Con\ngress, as well as his own\nviews on the state of the\nUnion, contained in his in\naugural address. In the\nopinion of Mr. Elsenhower,\nthis is inefficient and in\neffective procedure.\nRole Up to Party\nFormer President Truman\nhas never taken himself out\nof the picture in his own po\nlitical party, or out of poli\ntics. He has disliked the\nidea of being an elder states\nman describing an elder\nstatesman as a dead politi\ncian. Mr. Eisenhower de\nclined flatly at his final press\nconference to compare his\nown future political activi\nties with those of , Mr. Tru\nman. Indeed, the part Mr.\nEisenhower will play depends\nin large part on what the\nG. O. P. wants him to do, as\nexpressed by party leaders\nand rank and file. He is\nnot expected to consider him\nself titular leader of the Re\npublican Party\u2014a role that\nis usually assigned to the\nmost recent presidential can\ndidate, whether he has been\nsuccessful or has lost the\nelection. In fact, quite the\ncontrary. But he will stand\nready to advise his party and\nto work for it.\nThe outgoing President, at\nhis last press conference, set\nhimself firmly against a\nrepeal of the presidential two\nterm amendment to the Con\nstitution\u2014the Twenty-second\namendment. At first inclined\nto doubt the wisdom of that\namendment, which was pro\nposed by Congress and rati\nfied by the necessary number\nof States after conclusion of\nthe Franklin D. Roosevelt\nregime, Mr. Eisenhower has\ncome to the conclusion it is\na wise provision, a tradition\nviolated only once since\nthe days of the first Presi\ndent, George Washington.\nAlthough he did not say it\nIn so many words, there lies\nin an unrestricted number of\npresidential terms an op\nportunity of a self-perpetuat\ning dictatorship, a danger\nthat should be avoided. The\nargument against the two\nterm amendment has been\nthat the American people\nshould be free to make use\nof the services of any citizen\nas Chief Executive for as\nlong as they desire. This\nargues the indispensability of\nan individual in a country of\nnearly 200 million souls. The\nTwenty-second amendment\ndoes not now appear in any\ndanger of repeal, although a\nnew, youthful and vigorous\nPresident, John F. Kennedy\nof Massachusetts, is taking\nover. Much will depend upon\nthe success of his administra\ntion as to any real movement\nfor a return to the situation\nwhich permitted an election\nof the late President Roose\nvelt for a fourth term. No\nwar in which this country\nhas been involved has lasted\nmore than four years\u2014and a\nwar today might be limited\nin time to days or weeks or\nmonths, because of the weap\nons that have been developed.\nexperience as typical of sub\nway construction costs; they\nfrequently ignore the lower\ncosts in Washington, Boston,\nPhiladelphia, Toronto, and\nNewark, N.

Mass\nrapid transit costs, on the\nother hand, include the cost\nof the rolling stock. Highway\nand traffic engineers also ig\nnore the crippling effects of\nsnow and sleet storms on\nautos, trucks, and buses.

The nostalgia was what was interesting.\n\"Tell us,\" a reporter asked, \"how you are finding\nlife in retirement now. Do you sometimes feel that you'd\nlike to be back in the White House taking up the burdens\nthere? I know you are very busy. . ..\"\n\"Well, I'm very busy, that's correct,\" replied the\nretired five-star general. Then the famous Eisenhower\nbrow went into its furrow. \"But I have mixeti/feelings.\nI think each of us has his portion of ego and his confi\ndence that he could do some of these things pretty well,\nand I will say this\u2014at least one night I dreamed that\nthe Twenty-second Amendment (barring a third term)\nhad been repealed (pause for laughter) and it wasn t wholly\na nightmare\"\u2014more laughter.\nThe furrow smoothed and the grin flashed.\n* * *\n*lt has long been my judgment that the real threat\nto liberty in this republic will come not from any sudden,\ncalculated onslaught. Rather, the threat to our liberties\nwill be primarily found in a steady erosion of self-reliant\ncitizenship, and in excessive power concentration resulting\nfrom the lodging of more and more decisions in an ever\ngrowing Federal bureaucracy,\" Gen Eisenhower said. He\ncited the following as evidence:\nThe President's request for executive power to modify\nincome taxes at times; his proposal that the executive have\nauthority \"to finance . . . large-scale emergency public\nworks by diversion of funds dedicated to other purposes,\"\nthe Administration request for \"sweeping and repressive\"\nauthority over agriculture; the proposal for a Department\nof Urban Affairs, which would take over \"a whole host\nof state and local responsibilities,\" and the proposal \"to\ndilute the independence of the Federal Reserve Board by\nPresidential appointment of its chairman.\"\nTwist\n(Continued from Back Page)\nThe former President answered his own doubts in\nhis Kansas speech by saying: \"We are about to see a\nRenaissance in American pride in America.\"\nIn many ways that renaissance has already begun.\nIt comes not frum mere nationalist pride but pride in\nwhat the country stands for. What was wrong was a case\nof power corrupting\u2014or more properly materialism cor\nrupting. And the correction that has now begun is of\nthe best kind\u2014self-correction.\n* * \u2022\nDespite the spread of salacious literature and Holly\nwood's attempt to sell the most smirksome titillation,\nthere is a countertide now running. Young college stu\ndents have begun to criticize the commercialization of\nsex. New ventures in the erotic magazine field have\nbeen mercilessly panned by the \"sophisticates\" to whom\nthey were supposed to appeal.\n* * *\nMade aware of the danger* Americans put behind\nthem the excesses of monopoly, city bossism, speak-easy\nliving, Isolationism, and McCarthyism. They are now\nstruggling to control labor union monopolism, gangsterism,\nnew forms of government corruption, false advertising,\nstructural unemployment caused* by automation, and de\nlinquency caused by the wrenching of family life in a\nworld changed almost overnight from placid rural to\nfrantic megalopolis, from personal craftsmanship to dis\nembodied IBM robotry.\nsee\nDETROIT TRIBUNE, SATURDAY, MAY 26, 1962\n9", "batch": "mimtptc_bath_ver01", "title_normal": "detroit tribune.", "url": "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92063852/1962-05-26/ed-1/seq-9.json", "place": ["Michigan--Wayne--Detroit"], "page": "9"}, {"sequence": 22, "county": [null], "edition": null, "frequency": "Daily", "id": "/lccn/sn83045462/1962-06-13/ed-1/seq-22/", "subject": ["Washington (D.C.)--fast--(OCoLC)fst01204505", "Washington (D.C.)--Newspapers."], "city": ["Washington"], "date": "19620613", "title": "Evening star.

S. Space Exploration\nSuccess, Kennedy Says\nBy the Associated Press\nPresident Kennedy today\nhailed recent United States\nspace accomplishments and said\nthey have laid a substantial\nfoundation for greater future\nsuccesses.\nMr. Kennedy made the com\nment in sending Congress a re\nport on the activities of the\nNational Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration from October,\n1960, through June, 1961.\nSince that period, Mr. Ken\nnedy said. NASA, in co-opera\ntion with other agencies of the\nGovernment, \u201chas made sub\nstanial strides toward meeting\nour new and more ambitious\naeronautics and space goals.\u201d\nHis message was written be\nfore the country's latest spec\ntacular space venture\u2014the or\nbiting yesterday of the Telstar\nsatellite to pave the way for\nocean-spanning live television:\nThe NASA report was for\nwarded to Mr. Kennedy by the\nagency\u2019s chief. James E. Webb,\nwho spoke also of mounting\naccomplishments since June.\n1961.\nWeather Information\nByway of example. Mr. Webb\nsaid weather satellites are\nproviding valuable advance in\nformation on storms and that\ncommunications satellite re\nsearch holds promise of less\ncostly and more efficient com\nmunications between contin\nents. The report was written\nbefore the successful launch\ning of Telstar yesterday.\nThrough data from the\nflights of American astronauts,\nMr. Webb said, \u201cwe are learn\ning how well a man caji pilot\na spacecraft, how he can ad\njust to the weightlessness and\nother stresses of space and:\nwhat he can observe to add to\nthe information recorded by\nelectronic sensors.\u201d\nConcluding his letter to the\nPresident, Mr. Webb said:\nI \u201cIt Is clear that space re\nr search will add immeasurably\ns to man's knowledge of science.\nI technology, his own planet, the\n1 universe, and possibly the\n:, origin of life itself. The United\nStates is in the forefront In\n\u25a0 seeking, obtaining, and dis-\n\u25a0 seminating this knowledge.\u201d\nThe Senate, meanwhile, was\n! getting set to vote on a new\n. $3,802,515,250 space authoriza\n| tion measure.\nSenator Kerr.

He\n' said NASA has had so much to\n\u25a0 spend it has been raiding other\n' Government agencies for scien\n- lists.\nSenator Proxmire's second\namendment would require\n1 NASA to use competitive bid\nding \u201cto the maximum extent\npracticable,\u201d with a detailed\n\u25a0 record by the administrator\nwhen this was not done. He\n1 said NASA spending has nearly\ndoubled each year with no\nlimits now in sight.

The memorandum Itself,\ncirculated within FDA after\nMerrell withdrew the drug from\nthe market. \u2022\nLetter to Kennedy\nAmong the information is a\nletter to President Kennedy de\nscribing how non-Oovernment\nexperts told FDA that the drug\nshould not be released.\nWritten in August. 1982, by\nDr. Laurance W. Kinsell, di\nrector of the Institute for Me\ntabolic Research in Oakland,\nCalif., it said in part:\n\u201cA few years ago some of us\nwere asked by the Food and\nDrug Administration as well\nas by the Committee on Drugs\nof the American Medical Asso\nciation for an opinion with re\ngard to the drug triparanol\n(MER/29). The chief question\nwas whether it should be re\nleased for general clinical use\nby physicians.\n\u201cI stated, in totally unequi\nvocal terms, that I felt that\nthe drug should not be re\nleased; that it was a potential\nly dangerous drug until proven\notherwise, and that for a long\ntime it should be used only\nunder the most carefully con\ntrolled conditions.\n\u201cOther \u2018experts\u2019 gave near\nly identical opinions.\n\u201cThe Food and Drug people\nchose to disregard this advice\nand permitted the manufac\nturer to make the drug avail\nable for general clinical use.\nAs you are perhaps aware, the\ndrug was withdrawn from the\nmarket within the last few\nmonths because of disastrous\nconsequences attendant upon\nits use.\n\u201cAll of this could have been\navoided.\u201d\nThe drug was released in\nApril, 1960.\nLater, after reports of human\ncataracts in users of MER'29\nhad been circulated, four re\nsearchers set out to see if this\ncould have been shown in ani\nmals.\nThey found that in their\nmarkers they vandalized. Justice of the Peace\nHarold Hennessy, who imposed sentence, with\nheld the boys\u2019 names.\u2014AP Wirephoto.\nafter-the-fact tests, 34 of 38\ntest rats did indeed develop\n\u201ccataractous changes within 10\nweeks after triparanol feeding\nwas started.\"\nBefore FDA\u2019s release of the\ndrug, the agency\u2019s Division of\nPharmacology had also cited\n\u201csevere toxicity in some of the\nanimal testing,\u201d according to\npreviously reported testimony\nbefore the subcommittee, but\nthe division\u2019s objections were\noverridden.\n390,0 M Used MER/29\nAn estimated 300,000 patients\nused the drug. According to one\nestimate to the subcommittee,\nmore than 1,000 persons' in\njuries may be linked to it.\nAs side effects of the drug\nwere reported, members of the\nFDA staff became convinced\nthe drug should be taken off\nthe market.\nIt took a long fight to get\nthe drug company to agree,\nhowever. (Subsequent drug\nlegislation gives FDA more\npower in getting such drugs off\nthe market.)\nThe Merrell Co. could argue,\nin the case of the cataracts,\nthat these could have been\ncaused by other conditions,\nsome linked to aging.\nAccording to an account for\nthe subcommittee by Dr. T. J.\nKirby of the Mayo Clinic, sev\neral cases of side effects had\nbeen reported by the clinic to\nMerrell and much correspond\nence went back and forth about\nthem.\nChild Develops Cataracts\nThen, on March 21, 1962, Dr.\nKirby said, cataracts were\nfound to have developed in a\n6-year-old child, an unusual\ncase being treated with MER/\n29 for high cholesterol and a\nfat metabolism problem. The\nclinic notified the Merrell Co.\nA letter was later sent to the\nfirm detailing the case.

WILDER, Director, Delaware Game & Fish Commission\n/\n- /\n*\nThe White-tailed Deer, Delaware's only big game animal, is increasing in\nnumbers in our state as it is all across our country. Paradoxically, the white\ntailed is multiplying almost within shouting distance of expanding suburban\ndevelopments. In spite of our heavy population, Delaware has the enviable\nrecord of no fatalities during the seven shot-gun seasons for taking any deer.\nSince Delaware is about as hilly as a pool table, the short-range shotgun\nand rifled slug (also the pumpkin ball) is the legal weapon for the hunt. How\never, never sell short the killing power of the rifled slug at 50 or 75 y'ards, for\nit is a dependable big game weapon capable of penetrating a pine at least eight\ninches. Fact is, at close range it is superior to a high-powered bullet. It is\nlikely to be deflected by heavy underbrush.\nDelaware hunters will probably bring down about 600 \"white-tails\" in prime\ncondition during the eighth shotgun season on January 12 and 13. 1962. Hunters\nare urged to practice safe handling of firearms.

It is far worse than I've been able to reveal\nin a few words.\nThe treaty outlines a three-phase disarmament\nplan. All parties to the treaty would agree to do\naway, for all practical purposes, with their entire\nmilitary forces and all armaments within a period\nof something over six years. The only military\nforce, as such, remaining would exist only to be\nplaced at the disposal of the United Nations com\nmand. This would be called a \"Peace Force.\" As\nthe treaty puts it, 'oy the final stage of the plan:\nParties to the Treaty would complete the reduc\ntion of their force levels, disband systems of re\nserve forces, cause to be disbanded organizational\narrangements comprising and supporting their\nnational military establishment, and terminate the\nemployment of civilian personnel associated with\nthe foregoing.\" There are vague provisions for\nretaining armaments for forces which parties to\nthe treaty would be permitted to retain to main\ntain internal order and protect the personal se\ncurity of their citizens. Dictator states don't dare\npermit an armed citizenry. It is likely that the\nadministrators of the proposed treaty would per\nmit United States citizens to have weapons?\nSome members of Congress have since indicated\nthat this treaty does not include sporting weapons.\nIt doesn't mention sporting weapons specifically\u2014\nnor does it exclude them. It would be exceedingly\nnaive to expect specific mention of sporting wea\npons. However, if you read the treaty, you can\nsee that these can easily be included after the\ntreaty is put into force. But from that time on an\naroused American public won't mean much. The\ntreaty does refer to all armaments, with certain\nexceptions for what is apparently a police force.\nSubject to agreed requirements for non-nuclear\narmaments of agreed types for national forces re\nquired to maintain internal order and protect the\npersonal security of citizens, the Parties to the\nTreaty would eliminate all armaments remaining\nat their disposal at the end of Stage II.\ntold that sporting weapons are not included in the\ntreaty terms. Then try to get sporting weapons\n(carefully defined) excluded and see how far you\nget.\nBy VEJE BROWN\nThe Grim Facts About Disarmament\n. i\nIs the American Government about to sell the\nSecond Amendment (right to bear arms) for a\ndoubtful peace? Here are the grim, hidden facts\u2014\nAre the 30 million private American gun owners\na threat to peace and security in this country\u2014or\nthe world?\nYes, under certain conditions this is entirely\npossible. There is little doubt that this possibility\nof a threat was fully intended by those states, of\nthe original 13, which insisted on adoption of the\nfirst ten amendments to the United States consti\ntution. We can be forever thankful that some of\nthe original states were very suspicious of un\nbridled government power and demanded that\nthese amendments, later to be known as our Bill\nof Rights, be passed as soon as possible after the\nestablishment of the government to be formed\nunder the Constitution.\nOf course our response to the words \"peace\" and\nsecurity\" depends on our understanding of these\ntwo terms. Peace and security do not mean the\nsame to all people. To the growing cult of mild\nness, peace means simply freedom trom the threat\nof war. We can have this brand of peace any time\nwe seek it. All we have to do is surrender our\nsovereignty and our capacity for self-defense, and\nthereby throw ourselves on the mercy of the pow\ners that be. Security, to some people means being\ntaken care of from cradle to grave. These people\ngenerally reason that an all-powerful Federal\nGovernment is best qualified to take on this re\nsponsibility. We can get this kind of security at\nany time by merely surrendering our liberties.\nThose who seek the power to impose their will on\nthe majority are only too happy to assume full\nresponsibility for the peace and security of others.\nNaturally, those who relinquish their respons\nibility are expected to surrender their capacity to\ndisturb the \"peace.\" Not too long ago we had an\noffer to \"bury us,\" and I'm quite sure it was in\ntended that this service be rendered entirely free\nof charge.\nThe legislative attempts at outlawing guns can\nbe dealt with by an alert people, and wrong-way\nlegislation can be corrected; but there is an en\ntirely new threat looming big in the form of a dis\narmament treaty proposed by our government.\nIf accepted, it would leave us powerless to act.\nThe decisions relative to whether or not we can\nhave guns and the conditions under which we\nwill be permitted to use them\u2014if at all\u2014will not\neven be made by our government. These decisions\nwill be made by representatives from various\ncountries, including enemy powers. It also appears\nthat we would have foreign inspectors in this\ncountry to see that the conditions imposed on us\nare enforced. Our only recourse as a nation will\nbe through the World Court. The World Court\nconsists of 15 judges, of which one may be an\nAmerican. The other 14 will be from various\ncountries, including enemy countries. Can we\nexpect them to be sympathetic to our cause? Does\nthis sound like a pretty package? It is not exag\ngeration. Unless you have studied the provisions\nU. N. Peace Force' Would Rule World\nLegion Probers Find Jokers\nThe Chas. M. DeBremond Post No. 28 of the\nAmerican Legion, Roswell, N. M., last year created\na Committee to examine the Arms Control and\nDisarmament Act\u2014Public Law 87-297. Its chair\nman is James P. Risley, Lt. Gen. USMC (Ret).\nThe committee was set up at the time the U. S.\nmade its disarmament proposals at Geneva, based\non the State Department plan as submitted to the\nUnited Nations by President Kennedy and out\nlined in State Department publication No. 7277\u2014\nFreedom From War.\" Its report states:\n\"The objectives of the Geneva proposals, to\nwhich the U.S.S.R. must subscribe to put this law\ninto effect, is not disarmament but rather the arm\ning of the United Nations and the disarming of the\nmember nations. From the Communist point of\nview, this is of supreme importance. They know\ntheir superiority in political warfare, just as they\nare fully aware of their irremedial inferiority in\nmilitary strength and capacity. Therefore, the\nCommunists are interested in seeing the United\nStates disarm, as much as possible, a soon as pos\nsible, and as unilaterally as possible. We have\ngone a long way to accommodate them.\n\"Actually, under the provisions of the law, we\ncould be disarmed completely before the U.S.S.R.\nhad a single reduction in unit strength, according\nto State Department publication No. 7277.\nDisarmament Equals Surrender\nOur Bill of Rights will no longer have any\nmeaning\u2014least of all the Second Amendment,\nguaranteeing the right to keep and bear arms.\nSurrender our military forces, our armament and\nour sovereignty, and we are heading up a one\nway, dead-end street. After all of the blood that\nhas been shed to gain and protect our freedoms,\nwhy should we now offer them up on a silver\nplatter as a sort of sacrifice to the United Nations?\nDo we have the right to subject future genera\ntions to possible untold misery and possible en\nslavement because we have destroyed their means\nof protection?\nNow, if \u25a0 we disband our military forces, and\ndestroy all of our armament\u2014except what we\nturn over to the command of the \"Peace Force\"\u2014\nwho will then be the guardians of our liberties?\nPerhaps this deserves looking into. The United\nNations Security Council directs the UN military\nactions, and I presume that this will also be the\ncase with the UN \"Peace Force.\" I wonder how\nmany people know, that since the beginning of\nthe United Nations, the Undersecretary for Poli\ntical and Security Council Affairs has always\nbeen a Russian?\n1946 to 1949 Arkady S.

On the\nother hand, certain foods may\nshow no signs of spoilage and\nyet be responsible for gastroin\ntestinal disturbances.\nThe most common type of food\npoisoning is called \"staphylo\ncoccus\" and is probably respon\nsible for about 90 per cent of the\noutbreaks due to bacteria. The\norganisms are commonly found\non the skin of a carrier or in\nthe throat. These organisms may\nreadily gain entrance to such\nfoods as cream puffs, cream-fil\nled cakes, cooked ham, chicken\ngravy, sausage, milk, cheese,\netc. If these foods are left at\nroom temperature for several\nhours, the bacteria find ideal\nconditions for multiplication and\nfor the bacteria growth to devel\nop so as to withstand boiling\nor cooking for 30 to F0 minutes.\nThe consumption of infected iood\ncauses the onset of illness gen\nerally within two or three hours.\nTvnical symptoms include\nnaus\nea, vomiting, diarrhea, and ab\ndom inal cramps. Although the\npatient may b 0 extremely ill,\nrecovery is usually rapid.\nA very different form of food\npoisoning is botulism or botuli\nnus poisoning. This type of pois\noning needs ideal conditions for\nthe bacteria to grow. If given\nsuitable food and if the air is\nexcluded, as in improperly seal\ned cans of meat or vegetables, it\nwill produce a very deadly exo\ntoxin, Frequently there are no\napparent signs that th P food is\nnot edible. The symptoms, usual\nly appearing within one or two\ndays, are notably different from\nthose of other forms of bacterial\nfood poisoning. There is little or\ni no abdominal pain, but there is\nP ara ly sls \u00b0f the muscles of the\ne ^ es , caa sing double vision, and\nof f the . thro a t resuitmg m diffi\nI ealty in swallowing and speak\nj an< ^ ^ a * ei ' respiration, a con\ndition which often results in death.\nbe curried out especially with\nhome-canned vegetables that are\nlow acid and meats including fish\na nd poultry.\nAn antitoxin has been dcvclop\ned for The five known strains of\nboTulinum, but it is of little\nThe botulinus toxin can '-be\nj destroyed by a few minutes of\nboiling, a precaution that should\nvalue after advanced symptoms\nappear.\nTo avoid any type of food pois\noning\nin the home there are\nmany steps the homemaker can\ntake in reducing the possibility\nof it happening.

During the holidays\nor whenever a meat or poultry\nproduct is prepared and served\nwith a bread-egg dressing the\ntwo products should be separated\nas soon as possible and each re\nfrigerated. When serving home\ncanned foods that are of low\nacid content such as vegetables\nand meats they should be cooked\nto a boiling temperature and let\nthe food simmer for 10 to 15\nminutes. Th e low acid vegetables\nof beans, peas, beets, asparagus\nand corn that have been pre\npared by home canning should\nnever be served in a non-cooked\nsalad.

Yet that\ndocument itself prescribes\nthe methods of amendment,\nand the fact is that the Con\nstitution has oeen amended\n22 times since the founding\nof the Republic.\nMr. Kennedy has a right to\noppose particular amend\nments that he doesn\u2019t like.\nBut he will be regarded as\nout of bounds when he de\nclares that people who rant\nto amend the Constitution\nare not \u201cdefending\u201d the Con\nstitution, particularly when\ntheir purpose in the instance\nreferred to is to secure the\nadoption of specific amend\nments that will preserve and\ndefend the basic orinctples\nof the Constitution itself\nagainst usurpation and abuse\nof power.\nThe President\u2019s words, as\nthey appear in the White\nHouse transcript of Wednes\nday's news conference, were\nas follows:\n\u201cIt has always seemed to\nme remarkable that those\npeople and organizations who\nare founded In order to de\nfend the Constitution should\nseek to change it, and par\nticularly to change it in such\na basic way, either to affect\nthe power of the Congress to\namend the Constitution and\nput severe limitations upon\nthe Congress\u2014which, after\nall. represents the people\nmost directly\u2014or otherwise\nto affect the power of the\nSupreme Court, which is one\nof the most important pro\ntections of individual rights\nand one of the most impor\ntant securities we have for\nan amicable settlement of\ndisputes, and which, after\nall, became such a signifi\ncant part of our American\nconstitutional development\nunder the leadership of an\nAmerican who is usually\nheralded\u2014Mr. John Mar-\nDORIS FLEESON\nSome Didn't Come to Dinner\nG. 0.

Oov.\nRockefeller chose to honey\nmoon, former President Eis\nenhower to play golf at Au\ngusta, Richard Nixon was\nmoving to New York, Gov.\nScranton said he was busy\nat Harrisburg with his\nlegislature.\nThis left the honoree and\nGov.

But there\nprobably are several members\nof the Central Committee who\nprefer a more conciliatory atti\ntude toward the Chinese who\nwill exert pressure on Mr.\nKhrushchev to make a mean\ningful compromise with the\nChinese Communist Party.\nRussian Reply Delayed\nThe Russians have not yet\nreplied to yesterday's note from\nPeking which accepted Moscow\nas the place top the peace talks,\nbut asked for a month's post\nponement from May 15 to mid-\nJune.\nMoscow is expected to agree\nto the June date. Chinese\nleader Mao Tse-tung\u2019s agree\nment on Moscow as the site of\nthe talks was a concession to\nthe Russians, since Mr. Mao\nhad first suggested Peking as\na meeting place two months\nago.\nIn coming weeks, experts\nexpect the Chinese leaders to\nshall. So I would think that\nthe efforts will come to noth\ning, and I will be glad when\nthey do not.\u201d\nBut Mr. Kennedy failed to\ntell his audience that the\ncurrent movement to amend\ncertain parts of the Con\nstitution has grown out of\nthe controversy over who\nshould apportion the voting\ndistricts in a State and other\ninstances of alleged usurpa\ntion of power by the Su\npreme Court\u2014which has no\nright to amend the Consti\ntution. The proper methods\nat present for making\nchanges in the Constitution\nare specified in the docu\nment, itself.\nMr. Kennedy apparently\nhasn\u2019t looked into the pro\nposals which have been made\nrecently by various organiza\ntions of citizens and which\nalready have received the\nsupport of several State leg\nislatures.\nFirst of all. it is im\nportant to emphasize some\nthing which the general pub\nlic may not realize and which\nperhaps high officials in our\nGovernment have brushed\naside namely, that the\nConstitution can be amended\nin other ways than by a two\nthirds vote of both Houses\nof Congress and ratification\nby three-fourths of the State\nlegislatures. It can be done\ndirectly by the people.\nFor Article V of the\nConstitution provides that\nCongress, \u201con the application\nof the legislatures of two\nthirds of the several States,\nshall call a convention for\nproposing amendments,\nwhich, in either case, shall be\nvalid to all intents and pur\nposes, as part of this Consti\ntution, when ratified by the\nlegislatures of three-fourths\nof the several States, or. by\nconventions in three-fourths\nthereof, as the one or the\nother mode of ratification\nmay be proposed by the\nCongress.\u201d\nIt so happens that the fa\nmous Prohibition Amend\nment was repealed and\nthe Twenty-first Amendment\nsubstituting for it was adopt\ned without being submitted\nto the legislatures of the\nStates. It was ratified instead\nby conventions in two-thirds\nof the States summoned by\nthe State legislatures. It took\nonly nine months to accom-\ngood notices and Inhale thtir\napplause.\nA serious and potentially di\nvisive Goldwater candidacy\nseems inevitable unless and\nuntil Republicans soon find\na number of broad channels\nthrough which to funnel\ntheir obvious vigor and con\nfidence. As the showdowns\napproach, G. O.

The first would\nclarify the language of Arti\ncle V and simplify the proce\ndure so that, whenever two\nthirds of the State legisla\ntures submitted identical\ntexts of a particular amend\nment to be voted on and it\nwas then approved by three\nfourths of the State legisla\ntures, the amendment would\nbe automatically certified as\nhaving been adopted.\nThe second amendment\nproposed would preclude\nFederal consideration of\nmatters relating to reappor\ntionment of State legisla\ntures.\nThe third proposes the\ncreation of a \"Court of the\nUnion\u201d which would have\nthe final say in matters of\nconfuting State - Federal\nclaims of power under the\nConstitution.\nThese three amendments\nwould, of course, be valid\nonly if adopted under either\nof the two existing methods\nnow prescribed in the Con\nstitution. A dozen State leg\nislatures already have ap\nproved the first amendment,\nanother dozen the second\nand three the third.\nThe National.

But, in\nfact, the space program has\nbecome a fief for the rotari\nans of this world while the\nmost distinguished members\nof the scientific community\nare indifferent if not hostile\n\u2014a state of affairs apt to do\nharm both to the program\nand the scientific community.\nThe rotarian character of\nthe program is depressingly\nobvious. Its public purpose\nis crude\u2014victory in a race to\nthe moon. Its chief political\nbackers have been famous\nwheeler-dealers Lyndon\nJohnson and the late Senator\nRobert 8. Kerr. It is run by\nmanagerial types oriented\ntoward the areospace indus\ntry. Its face is the ballyhoo\nsection of the Luce publica\ntions; its voice, the soporific\nhomilies of Col. Glenn.\nNo less obvious is the dis\ntance taken by the scientific\nestablishment. Os the 30 or\n40 distinguished men who hold\nthe prize professorships at\nHarvard. Yale, Columbia,\nPrinceton, Chicago and Cali\nfornia. not one is identified\nwith\u2014much less actively en\ngaged in\u2014the space program.\nIn private, many have voiced\nsharp criticisms of the pro\ngram\u2014notably, the man on\nthe moon, or Apollo, project.\nTheir views have been echoed\nby the most thoughtful and\nsensistive members of the\npress and the Congress. Sen\nator Fulbright, for example,\nin the Clayton lectures last\nTHE EVENING STAR\nWsiAingten, D. C., friday, May 10, 1903\nweek, asked whether space\nexploration \"is a more impor\ntant and pressing national\nneed than other needs such\nas employment and education\nand urban renewal.\u201d\nNo doubt the scientific es\ntablishment has its reasons\nfor standing aloof. It has\ncome to grief in the past\nwhen it lent prestige to men\nmore keen for power than\ntruth. It has been systemati\ncally bypassed by the space\nagency on major decisions as\nto the purpose, pace and de\nsign of the program. On one\nimportant recent decision, in\nfact, NASA would not even\nwait for the results of a study\nby the President\u2019s Scientific\nAdviser. \u2666\nBut the way to alter the\nbalance in the space pro\ngram is not to stand outside\nand snipe. The Nation is\ncommitted, and it will not be\nmuch moved by generalized\ncharges likening the pro\ngram to an exercise in \"leaf\nraking.\" What can be altered\nis the relative emphasis on\nprojects within the program.\nBut that can only be ac\ncomplished through detailed\n1 comment by thoughtful sci\nentists who have become\nversed in the program through\nwork on the Inside. With\nout such statements, indeed,\nthe public has no standard\nfor gauging the program ex\nl cept the standard of reach\ning the moon. Only those\ni on the bandwagon, in other\nwords, can shape its course,\nI and Indicate other directions\nit might be taking.\nParticipation by the scien\ntific establishment, more\nover, can do more than im\nprove the present quality of\nA-9\nthe program. It can decisive\nly affect the enduring char\nacter of the space effort.\nFor whether this country\nreaches the moon first, as\nseems increasingly possible,\nor whether Russia takes the\ncigar, the winning of the race\nwill spell the end of the\npresent justification for the\nspace program. The oppor\ntunity to go beyond the moon\nwill beckon, and the door will\nbe open to a new and more\nsensible rationale\u2014a ration\nale that might include as one\nof its important components,\nthe pursuit of knowledge for\nits own sake. The more so, as\nthe handful of first-rate\nyoung scientists who are in\nthe program report that\nspace study affords unique\nclues to some of the classic\nhumanistic problems that\nhave always intrigued the\nmost serious men of science:\nProblems such as the origin\nof life, for example, or of the\nsolar system.\nTo be sure there is some\nthing seedy about using the\nspace program as a cover\nfor serious scientific inquiry.\nStill the atmosphere of the\naffluent society offers only\nrare openings to direct public\nenergies and resources to\npurposes that are not vain.\nFor the most eminent scien\ntists to overlook the power\nful grip of space on the pub\nlic imagination would be to\nforego an almost unique op\nportunity for the advance\nment of science.

He\nsaid:\n\u201cI think that one main reason\nis that they are nostalgic for a\nsimpler form of society, where j\npeople are not so dependent on >\neach other, and on government,\nas they are these days. Many\npeople look back to an earlier\nday when, supposedly at least,\nfarmers owned their own small\nfarms and marketed their own\ncrops, and a shoemaker made\nshoes and sold them to his\nneighbors.\n\u201cSome of the people who\ncherish this atavistic vision of\nthe good life are probably them\nselves farmers who vote for\ngovernment acreage controls,\nreceive federal payments, and'\nmarket their crops through\nfarm cooperatives, which en\njoy special exemption from the\nanti-trust laws.\u201d\nHarris noted that \u201cwhether\nfortunately or unfortunately\u201d\ntheir concept of society does not\ncover \u201cthe realities of life in\nan industrial society in 20th\nCentury America.\u201d\nIndustrialization, he observed\n\u201cwill continue at an increasing\npace, and huge corporations will\ngrow huger.\u201d\n-o\nPATRONIZE\nOUR ADVERTISERS\nBIG REFRESHMENT VALUE!\nafter\nyou pour...\nthere\u2019s still\nlots more!\nKING SIZE COKE\n\u00bbr\u00ab. \u00bbr or\u00bb, \u2022: \u2022\nGET VALUE...LIFT...REFRESHMENT, TOO!\nNOW!

H.\nGrooms, who had already\nstayed his desegregation order\nfor 60 days apparently in hope\nthat the city would work out a\nsolution to its dilemma short\nof closing its parks.\nJudge Grooms\u2019s second\namendment of the order ex\ncepted Little League baseball\nfacilities located on city park\nproperty. The boys can play\nbaseball as before, on a segre\ngated basis\u2014even though the\nremainder of the parks in which\nthey play are officially closed\n\u2014at least until a decision\ncomes from the Fifth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals in New Or\nleans and an appeal of Judge\nGrooms\u2019s ruling.\nSince the order was based at\nleast in part on previous de\nFifth Circuit Court, there is\nsmall likelihood that it will be\ncverturned.\nMean while, Birmingham\u2019s\nparks are covered with over\ngrowth\u2014not all of it vcgata\ni tion.\nWith the passage of the de\n! segregation deadline it would\nseem logical that the city would\nhave either a desegregated\npark system, or no parks at all,\nthey having been closed to\navoid compliance with the de\nsegregation order.\nWhat actually exists is a\nstrange mixture of both.\nFour golf courses, including\none foi Negroes, are closed.\nSo are municipal swimming\npools and community houses\nfor both races. So are some\nparks, or parts of some parks.\nBut the stadium, Legion\nField, has five Southeastern j\ni\nConference football games and\nmore than a score of high\nschool games\u2014both white and\nNegro\u2014scheduled for the fall.\nLegion Field is operated on\na lease basis and individual\nschools sell tickets to their\ngames.\nMunicipal Auditorium is now\nreserved for \u201cwalk-around\u201d\nevents (such as displays, where\nvisitors to the auditorium can\ncirculate about with no prob\nlem about segregated seating\nfacilities) or use by private\ngroups.\nThe zoo, a botanical garden\nI still under construction, the\npark atop Red Mountain from\nwhich the towering figure of\n| Vulcan looks out across the\ncity, and a park downtown\n(from which benches have\nbeen removed) are also still\nopen.\nEverything else, theoreti\ncally, is closed. Some golfers\ncontinued to use the courses\nfor a time after they were or\ndered shut down (even though\nth | city had filled the cups\nwith sod) but Public Safety\nCommissioner Eugene \u201cBull\"\nConnor has lately ordered po\nlice to keep all posted property\nclear of \u201ctrespassers.\u201d\nMayor Arthur J. Hanes,\nhowever, has hinted that spe\ncial permits might be granted\nto private groups for \u201coutings\u201d\non park property. Also, some\nparks adjacent to . public\nschools are still used ae play\ngrounds during school hours,\nand closed community houses\napparently can be used under\ncertain conditions.\nThere has been some local\ninterest in buying park facili\nties for private recreational\nuse. One group formed for\nsuch a purpose has raised some\n$20,000 of $400,000 it estimates\nwill be needed to buy the Roe\nbuck golf course and commu\nnity center. Other citizens,\nthey will fight in the courts\nany attempt by the city to dis\npose of public property.\nPerhaps the most significant\ndevelopment in the parks con\ntroversy has been the out\nspokenness with which con\nservative businessmen and\ncivic and religious leaders\nhave remanded that some at\ntempt be made to reach an\nOffice Space\nFor Rent\nUpstairs\nKollege Cleaners\nBuilding. i(L\nLynch at Dalton\nCall FL 2-1213\narrangement under the court\norder with which both races\ncould live together and through\nwhich the city parks could be\nkept open. Both daily news\npapers disputed the closing of\nthe park, and open debate\nraged for some weeks through\nvarious channels \u2014 speeches,\nmeetings, public statements,\nand letters to the editor.\nThe three city commission\ners, however, adamantly re\nfused to consider any plan\nwhich entailed the slightest\ndegree of desegregation. They\nmaintained that they were\nelected on firm segregationist\nplatforms\u2014which they were\u2014\nand that to accept integration\nof the parks or anything else\nwould be to break faith with\nthe voters who put them in\noffice.\nSome of their major backers\nin the business community\nwere among those urging at\ntempts to keep the parks open,\nbut the commissioners wouldn\u2019t\nbudge.\nThey point out that many of\nthe leaders of the call for open\nparks do not even live in Bir\nmingham, but in the fashion\nable \u201cover the mountain\u201d com\nmunities of Mountain Brook,\nHomewood, and Vestavia, and\nthat they have consistently re\njected merger with the parent\ncity.\nIt is something of a paradox,\ntoo, that at a time when sub\nstantial white sentiment for\nopen parks \u2014 which under the\ncourt order can mean only one\nthing, mixed parks \u2014 leans in\nthe direction of accepting at\nleast a limited degree of deseg\nregation, solution of racial\nproblems actually seems to be\nin the process of becoming\nmore difficult.\nThe city commissioners, elect\ned to four-year terms last year,\nare unbending in their segrega\ntionist positions.\nAt the same time there is\n| evidence that conservative, in\n' fluential Negro leaders who\nhave thus far been able to ex\nI ercise some restraint in de\nmands of their race locally, may\nbe having more and more trou\n| ble keeping some younger Ne\ngroes, who are impatient with\n; apparent unwillingness of city\nofficials to demonstrate even\ntoken compliance with a court\norder to desegregate one muni\ncipal activity, from pushing fall\nspeed ahead for integration of\nevery area of community life.\n| Moderate leaders of both\nraces are still hopeful of reach\ning agreements, even though\nbiracial meetings (quite rare\ni in Birmingham in recent years)\nheld during the parks contro\nversy failed to produce tangi\nble results or concrete propo\nsals.

MIKE MANSFIELD\nMontana received $2.10 in federal funds for every $1.00\nit paid to the federal government in fiscal year 1962.\nThe growing importance of federal expenditures to the\nState's economy was highlighted in figures just released by\nthe nine Cabinet-level departments and four independent agen\ncies operating in Montana. These agencies dispensed a grand\ntotal of $346,321,832 in goods and services, while the Internal\nRevenue Service was collecting $162,892,000 in taxes from\nindividuals and businesses.\nThe ratio of expenditures to re\nceipts was roughly 2.1 to 1, top\nping by a considerable n\\argin the\n1961 ratio of 1.8 to 1, The figures\nreleased by the agencies included\nall expenditures-not only in di\nrect grants, but for salaries, goods\nand services.\nMilitary spending accounted fo'r\nthe greatest part of the increase. The\nDefense Department expended a rec\nord $135.5 million, an increase of\nnearly $60 million over the previous\nyear. The bulk of this was devoted\nto expansion of air base facilities in\nGreat Falls and Glasgow and con\ntinued construction of Minuteman\nmissile sites across central Montana.\nAGRICULTURE SECOND\nLARGEST\nMontana's second largest federal\ncustomer was the Department of Ag\nriculture, which spent $76.7 million\nin its multiple programs. This was\na decrease of some $4 million from\nthe 1961 figure.\nIn third place was the Commerce\nSheep Dam would endanger fewer\nsalmon than Nez Perce. The salmon\ncome up the river to spawn.

Owen Hurd, WPPSS mana\nger, recalled that electric company\nofficials opposed Grand Coulee Dam\nbecause \"there's be no one to use it\nexcept jack-rabbits.\nPerce power will be needed \"as quick\nly as it can be brought on the line.\n* Levy's final point\u2014that the pub\nlic group couldn't begin building Nez\n' *\nby Levy, that may help the five pow\ner commissioners redeem President\nKennedy's 2-year-old promise.\nPerce \"without a long drawn-out con\ntest with hostile local authorities\"\u2014\nparticularly incensed WPPSS offi\ncials.\n\"This gratuitous suggestion-for\nwhich there's no support in the\nrecord-can only encourage pri\nvate power companies to increase\nlitigation threats to thwart public\ndevelopment,\" said Radin. Under\nthis theory, \"the side with the big\ngest battery of lawyers and the\ngreatest skill in legal harrassment\nshould develop the nation's water\npower.\nUnder the Federal Power Act, non\nprofit agencies have preference in\ndeveloping public resources. Those\nthat want to develop the public's re\nsources and charge the public a toll\nfor doing so must take a back seat.\nIt's this preference, largely ignored\nDepartment with expenditures of\n134.9 million, much of which went\nto the State in the form of aid for\nhighway construction. The Depart\nment of the Interior was a close\nfourth, with $31.7 million. Other\nagencies making substantial contribu\ntions to Montana's economy were the\nVeterans Administration, $27 mil\nlion; the Department of Health, Edu\ncation, and Welfare, $14 million, and\nthe Post Office Department, $11 mil\nlion.\nOfficial estimates by the agen\ncies for 1963 expenditures indicate\nthat the 2 to 1 ratio will be main\ntained, although the grand total\nmay be somewhat below that of\nfiscal 1962. The main factors in\nthe reduced total is expected to be\nthe cutback of some $39 million\nby the Defense Department, re\nflecting completed construction of\nMinuteman missile installations.\nSome of the larger projects author\nized for 1963 will include $2.5 mil\nlion for further development of fa\ncilities in and around Glacier Na\ntional Park, $5.5 million for the Mis\nsion 66 program in Yellowstone Park\nand $735,000 for construction of an\nairport at West Yellowstone, $5.7\nmillion for construction of a new\ncourt house and federal building in\nBillings, $12 million for construction\nof Yellowtail Dam, $5.6 million for\nConstruction of the East Bench recla\nmation project at Dillon, and $395,\n000 for the Sidney Soil and Water\nResearch Center.\nFarm Leaders Exchange . .\nYoung Formers\nUnion Leader\nGoes to Egypt\nGREAT FALLS\u2014Larry Holtz, 25,\none of the younger leaders in Mon\ntana Farmers Union, is one of five\nAmerican farmers who arrived in\nCairo, Egypt, yesterday for a month\nlong visit.
